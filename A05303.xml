            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is a duty impoſed vpon parents by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to provide for the education and maintenance of their infants: ſo it is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge allowed vnto the ſtudious, both by reaſon and cuſtome: to ſecure the fruits of their ſtudies from the detractions of the envious, by the countenaunce and patronage of ſome great perſonages, either excellent for their vertues, or eminent for their greatneſſe. Vpon this ground (as alſo vpon ſome other ſpeciall inducements) I have preſumed to
<pb facs="tcp:8919:3"/>preſent vnto your Highnes this Treatiſe touching the Apparition of Spirits: and diſcourſing of the Nature, properties and power, both of Angels, Divels, Sorcerers, Witches, and ſuch like. One of the ſpeciall reaſon; inducing me herevnto, is: for that as the firſt Authour thereof, a Frenchman and a Civill Lawyer, did dedicate it to the Queene mother of Fraunce <hi>Katherine de Medicis,</hi> a great Princeſſe: to whom (it ſeemeth) in regard of his particular preferment he was ſpecially obliged: ſo my ſelfe, his like in profeſſion (though wanting the meanes of like hope and fortune) had a deſire that this French ſtranger (now made an Engliſh Deniſon) might ſoiourne here vnder the royall protection of your Greatneſſe: whoſe excellency of puiſſance, ſurpaſſing knowledge, and princely vertues exempted from compariſon, have made you obſerved of the greateſt, admired of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt, and endeered in the love and hearts of all good men.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Motive was, the deſire of the partie by whoſe Motion I vndertooke to bring him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Engliſh: who being a man worthily regarded of the beſt, and not vnknown to your Maieſtic, did wiſh to have him preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your Highneſſe. The third and laſt (though not the leaſt cauſe) which drew both our deſires to concurre in this point, was: that I may vſe his owne wordes written to a great Peere of this Realme, touching this Treatiſe: <hi>Becauſe your Maiestie hath heretofore moſt religiouſly and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly written of this Argument, and hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, That Witches are the generation of Vipers,
<pb facs="tcp:8919:3"/>and the ſeede of the wicked Serpent: whoſe head you have alſo bruiſed, both by divine lawe, and by Act of Parliament.</hi> Wherefore ſeeing this ſtraunger is not onely a profeſſed foe to all theſe damned artes, and diabolicall illuſions of Witches, Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and Coniurers, and to all their fauourers and adherents: but like a ſtoute and moſt worthie Champion, hath alſo overthrowne all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and troden their defences vnder foote: All theſe reaſons put togither, do yeeld me a full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that as your Highneſſe is beſt able, ſo you will moſt graciouſly bee pleaſed to patronize and protect him; and the rather, becauſe he is a ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. This fauour if your moſt excellent Maieſtie ſhall vouchſafe him: for mine owne part, as my heart was long ſince vowed yours in all dutie, love, and fidelitie; ſo my ſoule ſhall power it ſelfe foorth in prayers for the bleſſed preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Maieſtie in all happines, both of temporall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall felicitie.</p>

Another ſort of viſions, is by <hi>Imagination,</hi> which is done when our thought is rauiſhed vnto heauen, and wee ſee nothing by the exteriour ſenſes: but we imagine onely by ſome diuine and heauenly inſpiration: as was that of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts. 10.</note> when he was rauiſhed in an extaſie, he ſaw all ſortes of vncleane creatures, and heard a voyce, which bade him eate of that he ſaw. The third ſort may be ſaid Intellectuall: becauſe it is done onely in the vnderſtanding,<note place="margin">Daniel. 5.</note> as when <hi>Balthaſar</hi> ſaw a hand writing vpon the wall. To theſe three ſortes of viſions, we may wel adde a fourth and fifth, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in dreaming, and do preſent themſelues onely either in full ſleepe, or betweene ſleeping and waking, when wee neither ſleepe nor wake, which the Hebrewes call <hi>Tharde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi> And firſt for that in our ſleepe, when one dreameth, or ſeemeth to behold any thing, which ſhall betide and happen in very deede according as was dreamed. And thus doth <hi>Macrobius</hi> define a viſion, in his Commentarie vpon the dreame of <hi>Scipio,</hi> where hee diſcourſeth of all dreames in generall: and he produceth theſe examples. One dreameth (ſaith he) that his friend (whome hee thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to be away in a farre countrie) is returned, and the next day he ſeeth him, and findeth that his dreame falleth out to be true. Or he dreameth, that his friend hath left certaine money with him: and the next day hee ſeeth his friend repaire vnto him accordingly, &amp; to commit a ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of money vnto his truſt and fidelitie. And as touching that which is betweene ſleeping and waking, (which ſome
<pb facs="tcp:8919:11"/>call, <hi>To bee in a traunſe</hi>) It is when partly in ſleeping, and partly with the bodily eyes waking, one ſeeth any thing to appeare before him. Such was that viſion of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall or houſhold gods of the Phrigians, which <hi>Aeneas</hi> perceiued betweene ſleeping and waking, when hee was in Candye. For after that <hi>Virgil</hi> had ſaid a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That thoſe gods which <hi>Aeneas</hi> had ſaued, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the middeſt of the fire, at the burning of Troy, had appeared to him ſleeping: hee addeth in the end;

For when <hi>Aaron</hi> murmured againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> in that he did ſo manifeſtly and apparantly enioy this priuiledge, to ſee God face to face: he heard how God ſaid vnto him, That his ſeruant <hi>Moſes</hi> might ſee him with out any impediment; but that other Prophets ſhould ſee him onely by viſion.

               <p>Now as touching things not knowne nor ſeene, but imagined in the minde, they are for the moſt part ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and without corporall ſubſtance, or they are concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="tcp:8919:12"/>and vnderſtoode by humane reaſon, and gathered by demonſtrations: as, to beleeue that there is a God which gouerneth the world, and hath a care and ouerſight of mankinde. Now theſe Fantaſies (which may bee named alſo Intellectuall) are compriſed (as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> ſay) partly by ſimilitude: as <hi>Socrates</hi> by his Image: and partly by the proportion or Analogy of one thing to another, and that is either by way of encreaſe or diminution: by increaſe as <hi>Cyclops</hi> and <hi>Titius,</hi> Giants: by diminution as a <hi>Pigmey</hi> and a Dwarfe: and partly by tranſlation, as (wee ſay) the eyes of the breaſt: and by compoſition, as an <hi>Hippocentaure,</hi> a <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelaphe,</hi> and others ſuch like monſters compoſed of two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall kindes of creatures: and by the contrary of a thing, as death, by life. And generally thoſe things which are incorporall, and vniuerſall, are comprehended by the meanes of ſuch things as are corporall, according to the ſaying of the Ciuilians. For by the ground (ſay they) which oweth ſeruitude, and yeeldeth benefit, a man may compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the ſeruice and benefite belonging thereunto, which are things meerely incorporall.</p>
               <p>Now of al theſe kindes of Imagination (which we haue ſo amply and at large deſcribed) It may be gathered, that there are two ſortes of Imagination,<note place="margin">Two kindes of Imagination.</note> namely, one Intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and without corporall ſubſtance: The other ſenſible and corporall.<note place="margin">Intellectuall Incorporall. Senſible and Corporall. Imagination Intellectuall what it is.</note> The Intellectuall is the Fantaſie, of which is bred and engendred in vs a memory or remembrance (as the <hi>Peripatetickes</hi> ſpeake) and the diſcourſe of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoule: I meane that diſcourſe which is proper only vnto man: by the which he ballanceth and weigheth the things preſent, by thoſe which are paſt, &amp; foreſeeth by things paſt, thoſe which are to come after. For albeit the vnreaſonable creatures doe ſometimes ſeeme to haue a kinde of diſcourſe, or dreaming in them, (as is to be ſeene in Horſes and Dogges) yet this dreaming or diſcourſe in them, is no other, then meerely beſtial and brutiſh: which doth not accomodate nor apply it ſelfe, but onely to things preſent, by an vnreaſonable appetite &amp; deſire vnto
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8919:12"/>thoſe things which they loue, and by eſchewing and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring to their vtmoſt powers, that which may be feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or contrary vnto them.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>Epictetus,</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe fantaſies,<note place="margin">Theocritus.</note> which are ſodainly carryed by the outward ſenſes into the inward powers of the ſoule, and doe carry feare and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour with them (as namely, Thunders, Earthquakes, feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſights, &amp; terrours, and other ſuch like things, He ſaid very well, that they are common to vs with the brute beaſtes which are guided onely by their brutiſh ſenſes.

And if peraduenture it ſhall be obiected, that often times euen wiſe men themſelues are not exempted from theſe feares and apprehenſions: To this I anſwere: that it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but the bodie of man ſhould tremble and ſtart at thoſe things, as beeing framed and compounded of Spirits apprehenſiue, ſubtill, and ſenſible: but it is ſoone quieted, and (as it were) brought in temper againe by the ſoule, which doth reaſſure, and reſtore courage vnto it: As when one caſteth a ſtone into the water, he ſhal ſee the water for a while to bubble vp, and bee troubled; but ſoone after it returneth to it former eſtate.</p>

               <p>It followeth in our definition, <hi>(which preſenteth it ſelfe, and appeareth vnto men ſenſibly:)</hi> I ſay to men; becauſe Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe neuer appeare to any other creatures, but vnto thoſe which are reaſonable.<note place="margin">Numeri. <hi>22.</hi> Homil. <hi>13.</hi> in Numer. ſub finem.</note> And although wee read in the Bible, that the Aſſe of <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaw the Angel: yet (as <hi>Origen</hi> writeth) That was contrary to his owne proper nature, not onely that it perceiued, and ſawe the Angell, but alſo that God opened his mouth, and made him to ſpeake. So that both the one &amp; the other of theſe points, is (in very truth) an impoſsibilitie to all beaſtes, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable creatures: aſwell for that they want the Organ or inſtrument of mans voyce; as alſo for that they neither haue reaſon whereby to diſcerne Specters &amp; Phantoſmes from true bodyes: nor yet vnderſtanding, whereby to be illuminated with the bright beames of diſcerning ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our things: which doe onely enter into the conſideration of the ſoule, and into the diſcourſe &amp; iudgement of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane vnderſtanding. The conſideration wherof hauing with ſome preuailed more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was fit; who being not able to conceiue in their thoughts how an Aſſe ſhould be able to ſee an Angel, or to ſpeak, they were perſwaded (moued thereunto peraduenture with the authoritie of ſome <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi>) that the Aſſe was a Diuell diſguiſed, which <hi>Balaam</hi> by force of his magicke Charmes had coniured to cary him toward <hi>Balaac.</hi> But in my opinion, there is neither reaſon nor any apparance of truth in their ſaying. But we ought
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8919:13"/>rather to take the very litterall ſenſe and meaning of the Scripture, and to thinke that it was a very naturall Aſſe, and not forged and framed by enchantments.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is added in the definition of a Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>that it preſenteth it ſelfe against Nature:</hi> (That is to ſay) againſt that common order of things, which naturally is eſtabliſhed in the world ſince the creation thereof. So that all Apparitions aſwell of Angels as of diuels, may be accounted as myracles: and doe neuer ſhewe themſelues but that they preſage and fore-ſhew ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Beſides, this word <hi>(against Nature)</hi> doth put a difference betweene the name of a Specter or Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thoſe which the Latynes call <hi>Prodigium,</hi> and <hi>Portentum.</hi> The former of which, the Hebrewes name <hi>Mopheth,</hi> &amp; wee not hauing any apt tearme for it may call it a <hi>Prodigie:</hi> and the latter, (for that we cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe name it in our language) we may likewiſe call a <hi>Portent.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lauater ſaith, <hi>Portentum</hi> is a betokening of ſtrange things to come in time.</note> Nowe the Prodigie doth differ from a Specter, in that it commeth naturally, &amp; happeneth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: &amp; yet notwithſtanding doth alwayes preſage ſome euill or ſtrange thing to come. And the <hi>Portent</hi> is, when certaine Coeleſtiall bodyes vnuſuall and vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed (of which notwithſtanding a naturall reaſon may be rendered) doe appeare in the avre: as Comets, or Blazing-ſtarres, Flaſhings of fire, Lightnings in a cleere and faire weather, and others of this kind; which doe alwayes preſage ſome euil to enſue after a certaine ſeaſon. For ſo doth <hi>Foſtus Pompeius</hi> define <hi>Portentum,</hi> and all the <hi>Grammarians</hi> after him.

               <p>But to continue on with that which wee began, touching the diſcourſe of the Nymphes: we ſhall eaſily ſee, that the ſame may bee ſaide of them, as hath beene ſpoken of the Muſes, and the Sirens: And that each of them, according to the diſtinction and diuerſitie of the Elements, in which they are abiding, haue a quality and propertie, anſwerable and agreeable to the ſame: the which they neuer change nor alter. The <hi>Nymphes of the Ayre,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of the Nimphs of the Ayre, &amp; that harmonie is propet to them. Of the Nimph Melluſina.</note> haue the <hi>Harmony,</hi> (which the Greekes call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

The French (who do tell great wonders of her, and haue full ſtuffed their Romaunts with ſuch meruels) doe faine her to be a Diuell, that hath her abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Ayre, and fortelleth things to come. But touching that which they talke, how ſhe was <hi>Counteſſe</hi> of <hi>Melle,</hi> and of <hi>Luſignan,</hi> whereof ſhee ſhould bee called <hi>Melluſine;</hi> and that ſhe was married to <hi>Raymond, Earle of Poytiers,</hi> by whome ſhe had goodly children: ſeemeth in my opinion, a meere fable, like vnto that wee lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, of <hi>Lamia,</hi> and that of <hi>Egeria,</hi> who was ſaide to be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8919:27"/>conuerſant with <hi>Numa.</hi> And I can no more beleeue it, then thoſe olde wiues Tales, and idle toyes and ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Fayrie Pedoqua,</hi> &amp; of the <hi>Fayrie Morgua,</hi> and <hi>Alcina the Ladie of the lake of Aualon,</hi> and other ſuch like <hi>Fayries,</hi> ſo famouſly talked of, by the French, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh. For my part, I ſhuld rather think, that that which the French haue reported of <hi>Melluſine,</hi> they learned of the Iewes (who for a long time were abiding in France) and out of their <hi>Caball.</hi> For the Iewes do ſay that there is an <hi>Helias,</hi> which wandreth vp and downe in the Ayre, and foretelleth things to come: And that it is that voyce of the Bird, or <hi>Col hatſipor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.4.</note> which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh of: whereof we will ſpeake ſomewhat hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the Diſcourſe of Soules.

               <p>Now for a concluſion of al this Diſcourſe: certainely if all theſe Nymphes (of which I haue ſpoken) haue at any time appeared vnto men: It can not be imagined, but that they muſt needes be Spirits and Diuels. And the truth is, that euen at this day, it is thought, that in ſome of the Northerne Regions, they do yet appeare to diuers perſons. And the report is, that they haue a care, and doe diligently attend about little Infantes lying in the cradle: that they doe dreſſe and vndreſſe them in their ſwathling clothes, and do performe all that which carefull Nurſes can do vnto their Nurſe children. And ſurely the Auncients had the ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of them: For the Poets ſay, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> was kept in his Infancy of the <hi>Nymph</hi> or <hi>Fairie Meliſſa:</hi> and that <hi>Bacchus,</hi> as ſoone as hee was borne, was carried away by the <hi>Nymphes</hi> or <hi>Fayries,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nyſa was ſaide to be nurſe of Bacchus, and of her he is cal led Nyſeus.</note> to bee nouriſhed by them in the Denne or Caue of <hi>Nyſa:</hi> and that by them <hi>Hylas,</hi> a yong lad, was rauiſhed and carried away, <hi>Antinous</hi> taken, and <hi>Adonis</hi> pulled away from the Barke of the Myrrhe tree, which was his mother, transformed and Metamorphoſed. To be ſhort, if I ſhould recite all the Fables which are written of them, I ſhould neuer make an ende: Onely this I will adde, that thoſe <hi>Fairies</hi> or <hi>Nymphes,</hi> which I ſaid did attend about little Infants to dreſſe them as Nurſes, may well
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8919:28"/>bee thoſe Diuels or auncient <hi>Goddeſſes,</hi> which were ſaid to haue the charge of the <hi>birth of Children:</hi> and for that cauſe were named <gap reason="foreign">

Such a ſcorner needeth not any great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: becauſe it is ſufficient for him to bee ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially skilfull in any thing; ſo that hee can with a kinde of graue &amp; ſmiling grace, ſhift off the reaſons and arguments of thoſe, whoſe knowledge, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is ſo exceeding farre beyonde his, as during

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8919:32"/>they ſaid, that the <hi>Humane vnderstanding</hi> doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes worke with the <hi>Phantoſme,</hi> and with the thing <hi>Imagined.</hi> And it appeareth, that in dreaming of any thing whatſoeuer, we doe alwayes imagine it to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall: whereupon they conclude, that all thinges are corporall: &amp; therfore that euen God alſo is a corporall Subſtance, which is the greateſt abſurdity and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that can be imagined in the world. For if we ſhould reſtraine God into a body, we muſt alſo make him ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to a body (ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn Damaſcen</hi>) which, in a word, is to reſtraine and ſhorten the power and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of God: the which being infinitely aboue al ſubſtances, both corporall and incorporall, is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to their Category.<note place="margin">Exod 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> The reaſon that moued them to beleeue that God was corporall: was a place of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> (for they did not receiue nor admit of any Scriptures but the fiue Bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as ſayth <hi>Origen</hi>) wherein it is written, <hi>That God made Moſes to ſtay in the Caue of a rock or mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain: &amp; putting his hand vpon him, did ſhew him his hinder parts, not ſuffering him to ſee his face.</hi> And therefore, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, that <hi>Moſes</hi> attributeth vnto God a face, a hand, and other parts, they conclude, that God hath a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.

               <p>Now the occaſion, why the Sadduces did ſo egerly defend and maintaine, that God had a bodie; was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would deny all incorporall ſubſtances: to which effect they thus argued.<note place="margin">The argument of the Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> If God (ſay they) haue created any ſubſtances, he created them to his owne I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and likeneſſe: and therefore when he made man he ſaide, <hi>That he made him according to his own Image;</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:8919:33"/>therby, that he was of a corporal ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: becauſe that man, whome he formed to the paterne of his own face, is corporall. And if God haue made nothing, but what is corporall: It followeth, that the Angels and Diuels which are ſaide to bee Spirits, are nothing but meere fables: &amp; that there be not any ſoules, or ſpirits ſeparated from a corporall ſubſtance: and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that the ſoule of man is mortall, as the bodie: and hath no neede to be reunited thereunto by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall reſurrection.</p>
               <p>But it is eaſie to anſwere them; by denying plainely, that God is corporall,<note place="margin">The argument of the Sadu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces anſwered.</note> or hath any body. For albeit, the holy Scripture doth attribute, vnto God, handes, feet, face, eyes and other parts of a body: yet this muſt be vnderſtood ſpiritually; and by thoſe corporall and bodily members, we muſt imagine the ſpiritual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vertues of God (according as ſaith S. <hi>Gregory</hi>):<note place="margin">In Moralibus.</note> as, by his <hi>eyes,</hi> we muſt vnderſtand his <hi>foreſight and his knowledge;</hi> to the which all things are open, and from which nothing is hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and concealed: By his <hi>hand,</hi> is meant, his <hi>Almighty power and puiſſance:</hi> By his <hi>face,</hi> the <hi>plenitude and fulneſse of his glorie.</hi> By his <hi>hinder parts,</hi> his <hi>glorie</hi> is ſhadowed, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the vayle of ſome certaine forme and ſimilitude. And whereas they ſay, that the <hi>vnderſtanding</hi> doth work with the <hi>Imagination:</hi> and that wee doe imagine God to bee a corporal Subſtance: This hath no reaſon, nor any apparance of truth at all; but is an errour, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them, with the <hi>Epicures:</hi> to the which wee will aunſwere anone. And as touching the Angels: I doe greatly maruell how the <hi>Saduces</hi> can deny the bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; ſeeing that <hi>Moſes</hi> in many places doth make mention of them, and of their Apparition. We may therefore very well ſay of them, that they vſe the Bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as men vſe their Stirroppes, in lengthening, and ſhortning them, at their pleaſures. This is the reaſon,<note place="margin">Contra Tryph.</note> why <hi>Iustine Martyre</hi> did not rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon them in the number of the Iewes (and that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8919:33"/>worthily) but reputed them as <hi>Heretickes:</hi> not allowing them any place in the Iewiſh Church, by reaſon of the fond and abſurde opinions which they held, not onely of God, but alſo of the Angels, Diuels, and ſoules of men, which they affirmed to bee mortall. But as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this latter point, wee ſhall ſpeake more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Let vs now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the <hi>Epicures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt errour of the <hi>Epicures</hi> is,<note place="margin">The opinion of the Epicures</note> that God hath a bodie: as the <hi>Saduces</hi> did beleeue likewiſe. And their firſt Argument was, That nature it ſelfe (forſooth) did teach and admoniſh vs, to beleeue,<note place="margin">The firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picures.</note> that both God and all Celeſtiall eſſences were corporall; for two reaſons: The former was, becauſe the Gods are not figured in any other, then in a humane forme. And the ſecond, becauſe, whether it be in ſleeping, or in waking, when wee dreame or imagine of the Gods, no other forme doth preſent it ſelfe vnto our imaginations, but a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſhape: And therefore they conclude, that the Gods are in figure like vnto men. But vnto this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Cicero</hi> anſwereth ſufficiently;<note place="margin">Lib. de natura Deorum.</note> That ſuch humane ſhape, and forme, is attributed vnto the Gods,<note place="margin">Anſwere to the firſt argument of the Epicures</note> by the inuention of men: and that either it proceedeth from the wiſedome of the Auncients; who thought thereby they ſhould the more eaſily draw the ſpirits and minds of the ignorant, to the knowledge of ſpirituall, and ſupernaturall things: and that they ſhould the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner bring and reduce them into the way to liue well and vertuouſly: Or elſe that the ſame had it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and firſt footing from a blinde ſuperſtition: which doth moſt eaſily allure men to adore thoſe gods which are portrayed and carued in a forme moſt pleaſing, and agreeable vnto men: Or elſe that it is but a ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Paynters;</hi> who haue alwayes beene au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious to faine and deuiſe any thing, rather then that which ſhold be according to truth &amp; verity. And this laſt point may wel ſerue to anſwer that, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Epicures</hi> ſay: that be it in ſleeping, or in waking y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods do not preſét
<pb facs="tcp:8919:34"/>themſelues vnto vs, in any other, then a humane forme: For this is certain, that by the portraiture and pictures which we ſee of the Gods, in thoſe formes which are common and familiar vnto vs; we doe imagine (though falſly) that which may reſemble vnto vs, the ſame which we haue ſeene to be painted. Inſomuch, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> ſeemeth vnto vs, to haue a face and countenance terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with his haire blacke, and hanging backwarde, as <hi>Phidias</hi> did graue him. And <hi>Minerua</hi> had her eyes blewe, or of an azure colour: as <hi>Homer</hi> deſcribeth her. <hi>Mercury</hi> was painted like a young man, hauing his eyes alwayes open, as one that was euer waking: with bright yellowe hayre, and a yellowe downe vpon his chinne and cheekes, as if it did but newly begin to friz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle or to curle. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus</hi> had her eyes delicate and wanton, and her lockes of golde yellow. <hi>Iuno</hi> had groſſe and thicke eyes, riſing vp towardes her head, like vnto the eyes of an Oxe. And ſo generally were the reſt of the Gods painted by the Gentiles, in diuers formes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions. Notwithſtanding, all this proceeded of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but from the errour of our <hi>Imagination,</hi> which ſuffereth it ſelfe to bee deceiued and ſeduced, by the painting, which imprinted in it a kind of falſe notion. I ſay a notion: becauſe the ignorant common ſort of people, is perſwaded of the ſame, and ſuffereth it to take place in their minde, or <hi>vnderſtanding:</hi> which is as eaſie alſo to be deceiued, as is their Imagination. But a man of wiſedome and iudgement, (who hath his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding more cleare and open) is not eaſily there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall ſeduced: but notwithſtanding al paintings and fictions, his <hi>Intellect or vnderstanding power</hi> pierceth through the Imagination (as the Sunne pierceth or ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth through the cloudes): and ſpreading it ſelfe, with her light, doth eaſily beleeue in a ſpiritual manner, that God and the Angels are Spirituall.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond Argument of the Epicures.</note>The ſecond Argument of the <hi>Epicures,</hi> touching the humane bodie of God; was, that God tooke vpon him
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8919:34"/>that forme, which was, or could be imagined, to be the moſt beautifull in the whole world. And they ſay, that the humane forme, or ſhape, is of all others, the moſt goodly and excellent: And therefore wee ought to thinke, that God is carnall and corporall, as men are. Hereunto needeth no anſwere to bee made: becauſe the conſequence of their argument is not good:<note place="margin">Anſwere to the 2. Argument.</note> viz. That God ſhould retaine vnto himſelfe the Figure of a man, becauſe the ſame is the moſt excellent of all other creatures in the world. For the Diuinitie of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, nor can be, in any corporall ſubſtance: But it is an Incorporall and ſpirituall eſſence, which hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing common with that ſubſtance which is proper vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe earthly creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The 3. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Epicures.</note>The third &amp; laſt argument of theſe Philoſophers, is a Gradation or heaping vp of Syllogiſmes: which kinde of argument, the Greekes call a <hi>Sorites:</hi> and they frame it in this ſort; It is held and confeſſed of all, that God, &amp; all other celeſtial powers, are exceedingly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: But no perſon can be happy, without vertue: And vertue cannot bee preſent in any, without reaſon: and reaſon can bee in none, but in the figure and ſhape of man. Therefore it muſt bee granted, that the Gods, which haue the vſe of reaſon, haue the forme of man alſo. But the whole frame of this Argument,<note place="margin">Anſwere to the 3. Argument.</note> may ſoone and eaſily bee diſſolued, by denying, that reaſon can bee in no other, then in a humane ſhape: For both God and the Angels, who haue a diuine and ſpirituall vnderſtanding, haue the vſe of reaſon, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, that they be not of a corporal ſubſtance. And reaſon in man, commeth not of the humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: but from the ſoule of man, which is Spirituall &amp; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, made vnto the likeneſſe of God, and capable of reaſon, of prudence; and of wiſedome.</p>
               <p>Now, whereas it might be obiected to the <hi>Epicures;</hi> That in making their Gods to haue a humane bodie, they doe therein make them ſubiect to death and diſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.
<pb facs="tcp:8919:35"/>To auoide this abſurditie,<note place="margin">Abſurdities in the opinion of the Epicures.</note> they doe tumble into a greater; affirming, that their bodie is as a body; and their bloud, as bloud; not hauing any thing, but the lineame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a man, &amp; being exempted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all craſsitude &amp; thicknes: which, in a word, is aſmuch as to ſay, that their Gods were rather Idols of men, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very men; and rather framed by the paterne of men, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as men in truth &amp; ſubſtance: which is a thing the moſt ridiculous that can be imagined.</p>
               <p>But will ſome ſay, To what purpoſe ſerueth all this, touching our matter of Specters? I haue ſaide before, that the <hi>Saduces</hi> did maintaine God to haue a bodie, to the ende they might the better deny the appearing of Specters; which are ſubſtances without a bodie. Alſo the <hi>Epicures</hi> made their Gods to haue bodies; that ſo they might holde them in the heauens idle and doing nothing: and by conſequence might deny their Apparition vpon <hi>Earth.</hi>

For the diuels do not worke any domage or inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience to the world, being bridled &amp; reſtrained by the hand and power of God. And if they do torment men or tempt them, it is to exerciſe them, or to manifeſt the glory and iuſtice of God, of the which they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made the executioners.<note place="margin">S.

<pb facs="tcp:8919:37"/>and concuſsion of the Ayre, which falleth vnder the ſenſe of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> (as is affirmed by the <hi>Grammarians.</hi>) And the <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>voyce</hi> (as ſayth <hi>Galen</hi>) is the <hi>breath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. de Voce.</note> and reſpiration of the Lungs: but the <hi>forme</hi> thereof is the <hi>Ayre,</hi> without the which, neither can it be vnderſtood, nor can it bee called a voyce. Beſides I will not deny, but that the ſounds are rayſed within the emptie Ayre, bee it either by the windes, or by ſome other externall cauſe. But to ſay, that the voyces, and the ſounds are naturall and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent to the Aire, as the Tide to the Sea; and coldnes to the Riuers; and heat to the Sun: It would the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; follow, that without any externall cauſe at all, both the voyce, and the ſenſes ſhould bee created in the Aire, &amp; ſhould perpetually adhere vnto the Ayre, as the Tide doth to the Sea; and cold to the waters; and heat vnto the Sun. But ſo it is, that the winds are not alwaies in the Ayre: and the ſounds and voyces are externall thinges, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Ayre, by the meanes of ſome other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: the which is nothing ſo, neither in the Sea, nor in the Riuers, nor in the Sunne: becauſe that in the Seas the Tide; and cold in the waters; and heate in the Sun, are vnſeparably and continually. And there is great difference betweene <hi>Accidents</hi> that are <hi>Separable,</hi> and thoſe that are <hi>Inſeparable.</hi> For the ſeparable Accident as the <hi>Voyces</hi> and the <hi>Soundes</hi> in the Ayre, may bee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted and drawne from the ſubſtance of the Ayre, and yet the Ayre ſhall neither periſh, nor be the ſooner altered thereby: But ebbing and flowing cannot bee taken from the Sea, but the nature thereof muſt needs bee chaunged: Nor can the heate bee ſeparated from the Sunne, but that hee muſt then looſe his light: Neither can the colde bee ſeuered from the Riuers, but that the qualitie and nature of the water muſt bee chaunged: which cannot poſsibly bee, becauſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally water is cold. And theſe three Accidents, are inſeparably knit to thoſe three ſubſtances, no leſſe, then blackneſſe is to the Rauen, and whiteneſſe to the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8919:37"/>Swan. Moreouer, it is a farre greater foolery, to ſay, that of voyces articulated and knit together, the voices themſelues ſhould bee bred and engendred in the aire: For that is not onely againſt the nature of the Ayre, but againſt all order eſtabliſhed in the world. Neither is it to any purpoſe, to alledge for an inſtance, the voice of an <hi>Eccho:</hi> the which being carried in the Ayre, doth ſpread it ſelfe, and ſcattereth (as a ſparke from the fire) here and there, not onely towardes the partie that made and diſperſed the ſound,<note place="margin">The Eccho, whereof it commeth.</note> but to ſome other places likewiſe. For the voyce of the <hi>Eccho,</hi> is engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the voyce of the partie, and not of the aire, and is diſperſed (as themſelues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe) by the ſpeech of the man, from whome it tooke it original and firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Neither will I eaſily grant vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the voyce of the <hi>Eccho</hi> doth diſperſe it ſelfe on all ſides, without looſing it ſelfe, or being extinguiſhed. For it is a thing very notorious, and ſufficiently proued, that if the <hi>Eccho</hi> be diſperſed into another place, then that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence it firſt receiued her voyce, ſhee is no more diſcerned or vnderſtoode as the voyce of a man, but onely as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed &amp; vncertain ſound; which ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging throgh the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be diſcerned, but only for a reſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding noiſe, &amp; not otherwiſe. Now as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning thoſe Images,<note place="margin">Anſwere to their 2. argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes, which the <hi>Epicures</hi> alledge to be created in the <hi>thought, or conceit:</hi> ſaying, that the mind of man doth referre vnto the eyes, whatſoeuer it dreameth, or thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth on: &amp; that by means of the abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>courſe of the <hi>Atomes;</hi> I do make them the ſame anſwere, which <hi>Cicero</hi> yeelded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: That if the mind &amp; the eies do ſo ſym bolize &amp; agree together in operations, that whatſoeuer the mind ſhall imagine &amp; conceiue, the eye may preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee: It muſt needes then followe, that ſome thinges ſhall preſent themſelues to our eyes and ſight, which neuer were in beeing, nor euer can bee.

Neither can they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelues with the continuall concourſe of their <hi>Atomes,</hi> which (they ſay) doe vnceſſantly bring certaine Images into the minde, and into the eyes of men. For be it, that we ſhold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, that their <hi>Atomes</hi> do ſlide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the minde of man: how can they conclude thereof, that they deſcend into the ſight: nay, how can they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend; but that euen by their owne reaſons, their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſottiſhneſſe may be diſcouered. For, if their <hi>Atomes</hi> doe enter into the minde, it muſt needs be then by that meanes, that they bee <hi>Inuiſible:</hi> and that they doe flie vp and downe verie cloſely, and ſubtilly (as the verie word doth alſo import.) Now if they flie <hi>inuiſibly</hi> in the minde: how can they of themſelues ſo readily make any thing <hi>viſible</hi> and apt to bee ſeene? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to make their <hi>Atomes</hi> viſible and corporall, there muſt be of neceſsitie, before hand, a great concurrence and huge heape of them drawne together; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuddenly done, but will require a great time. Now in the meane while that theſe <hi>inuiſible Atomes</hi> ſhall bee a gathering and getting together into the minde, they will bee flitting and flying away ſome other where, as ſoone as the minde (which neuer retayneth one thing very long) hath put them out of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. So that by this meanes they haue not any leaſure to forme themſelues <hi>viſible</hi> to the eyes of the bodie: but they returne backe againe, euen as they came at firſt, <hi>inuiſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let vs proceed, and paſſe on to thoſe Images,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8919:38"/>which (ſay the <hi>Epicures</hi>) are reuer berated from the <hi>Aire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwere to the 3. argument of the Epicures.</note> being cleere and tranſparent in her <hi>ſuperſicies.</hi> I doe agree with them, that the <hi>Catoptike,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Speculatiue,</hi> (being one of the kinds of the Arte <hi>Optike</hi>) doth holde, that the refractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is made of forms, (be it either in a mirrour, in the Ayre, or in the water) commeth either of the denſitie and thickneſſe of the mirrour, poliſhed and made bright, the which keepeth ſight, that it doth not diſperſe and ſcatter it ſelfe: whereas otherwiſe, if the mirrour were tranſparent, or had any pores, whereby one might ſee through it, the ſight would diſperſe and ſcatter it ſelfe abroad: Or elſe it commeth of the thickneſſe of the Ayre next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning: or of the humid and moiſt concretion of the Water, which ſtaieth and limiteth the beames of the eye-ſight. And that is the reaſon, why one may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well ſee his viſage in the water, as in a mirrour or loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Glaſſe: and ſo alſo in the water of the Sea, when it is not troubled not toſſed with the windes, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth calme and quiet: which <hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But what will they inferre of this, which euery man will confeſſe to be true and infallible? So it is, (ſay they) that the Ayre being cleere in her <hi>Superficies</hi> (like as doth the mirrour or looking Glaſſe): ſo will it yeeld of it ſelfe, ſome forme or figure. Let this alſo be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them: And what of that? For ſooth they conclude, that therefore in the Ayre,<note place="margin">The Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men call this a Fallacie, <hi>A dictoſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quid ad id quod est ſim pliciter dictum</hi>
                  </note> a man may ſee figures and Images. But who ſeeth not, that this concluſion is ridiculous, and Sophiſticall: For it doth not anſwere to the termes of their propoſition: but ſimply carrieth away the Subiect, without ſpeaking of that, which is thereunto attributed, and which is the knot of the
<pb facs="tcp:8919:39"/>whole queſtion. But I would knowe of the <hi>Epicures,</hi> how they can proue vnto vs, that by their <hi>Atomes</hi> the Ayre may naturally engender formes and Images of themſelues, which ſhould be <hi>viſible:</hi> and, which ſhould be mouing and liuing, as the Specters are. I do aſſure me ſelf, that they haue not any arguments ſo good, but they may as eaſily bee diſſolued &amp; auoided, as was the former. But they will ſay, perhaps; that we ſee often in the Ayre <hi>Comets, Fiery Flames,</hi> and other <hi>Prodigies.</hi> True: this I will not deny: but theſe things (which they ſay are ſeene in the Ayre) doe not take their originall neither of their <hi>Atomes,</hi> nor of the <hi>Aire:</hi> but are enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred of the <hi>vapours</hi> dryed vp from the earth: as it is well known by the writings of good Philoſophers. And the Ayre is ſuſceptible &amp; capable of them, by reaſon of ſome emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines in it, which doth eaſily yeeld and giue place, and receiueth that which is ſent vnto it from below. Beſides it is very euident, that ſuch figures and Images as are ſeene in the <hi>Ayre,</hi> haue not any life in them, as haue the true <hi>Specters:</hi> the which alſo (the <hi>Epicures</hi> ought to ſhewe by good reaſons) to be carried to and fro, and to moue themſelues in the Ayre. For if they had attributed motion and ſtirring vnto <hi>Specters:</hi> and had proued, that naturally, without hauing any ſoule or life, they might notwithſtanding be ſeene wandring, and running hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thither, in our forme, or in any other: and that they are not onely to bee ſeene in all partes of the ayre, but in all other places whatſoeuer: then this might haue ſtood them in great ſtead, to haue impugned the Apparition of Specters, ſupernaturally, or againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if they will affirme, that the tranſparent and thicke Ayre, receiuing our figure by refraction, doth moue it ſelfe as we doe: and doth liue and change from place to place, as we doe: then muſt they alſo proue vnto vs, that the ſame ſhould be a Specter: and not the Image of the obiect oppoſed thereunto, the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8919:39"/>which vaniſheth away as ſoone as the ſame doth abſent it ſelfe from it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Of the Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Images formed in the Ayre, by way of reflexion.</note>And ſeeing we are now in the Diſcourſe of Images, formed in a thicke Ayre: It is to be vnderſtood, that their nature is to appeare either by the <hi>refraction</hi> of our owne naturall and proper forme, or by <hi>reflexion.</hi> As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their appearance by <hi>refraction,</hi> wee haue alreadie ſpoken ſufficiently:<note place="margin">Of Images ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the Ayre by reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and how it is done.</note> But as concerning thoſe which are by <hi>reflexion;</hi> It is moſt certaine, that their propertie is to appeare by another forme then ours: namely, of ſome lightſome bodie, which groweth into the thicke and groſſe Ayre, in the humid and moiſt concretion of the ſame: or into the Glaſſe of a mirrour, making a <hi>reflexion</hi> of that thing which is reuerberated and beaten backe againe into our ſight. Thus by way of reflexion may a man ſee within a looking Glaſſe, thoſe men which are walking and marching in the ſtreetes. And ſometimes a man ſhall thinke that men are walking neere the wals of his chamber; which notwithſtanding is nothing ſo: but that onely there is a reflexion of thoſe perſons who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſee aloofe, walking and going vp and downe. So likewiſe by way of reflexion, may a man ſee in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens ſometimes a ſecond Sunne, the Image of the true Sunne: and ſo likewiſe of the Rainbowe. Howbeit that this latter (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> would haue it) is not any reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but a <hi>relation</hi> of the <hi>Aſpect</hi> vnto our eye-ſight. But vnder his correction, that is not ſo: For if the Raine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe in the heauens doe not yeeld a reflexion to our ſight, it would not be ſeene in the water, or in a looking Glaſſe, as it is, and as dayly experience ſheweth vs. And this alſo may ſerue for a ſolution to that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Epicures,</hi> who by compariſon of the clothes of Tapiſtrie, that imprint their colours in the wall oppoſed, would proue, that the Ayre may al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o caſt any forme or Image of it ſelfe. For the coloures of the Raine-bowe, and of Tapiſtry Hangings are for the moſt part liuely coloures, as Azure or
<pb facs="tcp:8919:40"/>skye colour, red, carnation, and greene: all which doe naturally caſt a great luſter, which may eaſily yeeld an impreſsion vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any ſolid thing, &amp; may reflect vnto our eyes. And yet neuertheleſſe, I ſee not how this can be a good argument, to ſhew that the Ayre can engender formes or figures: which may referre themſelues to the eyes, as <hi>Specters,</hi> and not rather, as colours.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to the 4. argument of the Epicures.</note>Laſt of all, touching that which the <hi>Epicures</hi> affirme: how, of the bodies of things doe iſſue and remaine cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Spoyles: The ſame hath not any foundation vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon naturall reaſon, or vpon any apparance of truth.

               <p>Now it happened, that certaine Gentlemen hauing of along time perceiued and known this ſtrange nature and diſpoſition in him, did one day inuite this Gent. to dine with them: and hauing prouided and ſuborned a certain Minſtrel of purpoſe, they cauſed him to be kept cloſe till the appointed dinner time, when being ſet at Table, they had ſo placed the Gent. in the middeſt of them, as it was not poſsible for him to get forth. Now as they were in the middeſt of their dinner, in came the Fidler, and began to ſtrike vp his Violl neere vnto the Gent. he that neuer heard the ſound of that Inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but was preſently take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with an extreame deſire to piſſe, grew into an exceeding great paine: for being not able to get from the table, nor daring to lay open his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the whole company; the poore man ſhewed by the often change of his countenance, in what pitiful caſe and paine he was. But in the end hee was conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to yeelde to the preſent miſchiefe, and to reueale his imperfection. Hee that ſhould vndertake to ſearch and finde out the cauſe of this ſo admirable an <hi>Antipathie,</hi> I aſſure me ſelfe hee ſhould bee as long a time about it, as was <hi>Aristotle</hi> in ſeeking out the cauſe of the Flowing and Ebbing of the Seas, (whereof haue written <hi>Gregorie Nazianzon, Iuſtine Martyr, Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> and others) and yet he could neuer learne the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine cauſe thereof.</p>
               <p>But as touching the reaſon why the Lion doth
<pb facs="tcp:8919:42"/>flye from the Cocke: It commeth not from any ſeedes that lye hidden within the eyes of the Cocke, &amp; which from thence, ſhould ſtrike into the eyes, and hurt the ſight of the Lion:<note place="margin">The reaſon why the Lion flieth from the Cocke.</note> but it is by a kinde of <hi>Antipathie,</hi> whereof we haue formerly ſpoken. By which alſo the <hi>Eliphant</hi> doth fly from the <hi>Hogge,</hi> and the <hi>Horſe</hi> from the <hi>Stone Taraxippe:</hi> Or elſe it is for that the Cocke and the Lion, partaking both of them of the nature of the Sun (but the Cock more then the Lion:) It happeneth that the Lion perceiuing it, doth preſently flie from him; as the valiant <hi>Hector</hi> is ſaide to flie before <hi>Achilles,</hi> who was more braue and more warlike then he. Or elſe it is becauſe the Cocke, being a celeſtiall fowle, and the Lion a terreſtriall creature, and of a groſſer matter (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Spirits more ſenſitiue and brutall then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) doth therefore by nature yeeld and giue place, to that which is more excellent. And this reaſon ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto me in ſome ſort allowable: the rather, for that thoſe Diuels which are of a more materiall and terreſtriall nature, and bee called Diuels of the Sunne, do flye the voyce of the Cocke, aſwell as the Lion (as <hi>Pſellus</hi> teacheth vs). And thus, in my opinion, you ſee ſufficiently how all the Arguments and fooliſh dreams and fancies of the <hi>Epicures,</hi> may be ſoone anſwered, and eaſily diſſolued. Wee will now therefore conſider what the <hi>Peripatetickes,</hi> both ancient and moderne, do alledge to impugne all Apparitions againſt nature.</p>

But both the one and the other Interpretation is of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. For firſt <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaking of the firſt principles,<note place="margin">Anſwer to the argument of A.

For if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did vnderſtand the Starres, by the word Diuels, then muſt it needes follow by his ſpeech, that the Starres ſhould be engendred of the Elements: But the Starres in the Firmament aboue, cannot bee engendred of the Elementes beneath: either there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt <hi>Aristotle</hi> bee deceiued, or (which is more likely) he meant not the ſtarres (as <hi>Aphrodiſeus</hi> would make vs beleeue): but by the worde <hi>Demones,</hi> he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode ſimplie and plainely the Diuels.</p>

                  <q>When the minde (ſayeth hee) which is alwayes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on the Imagination) doth receiue in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any formes of diuels or dead men, either in ſound or in qualitie, in odour, or in touching. And that this Imagination is transferred vnto the Senſe, correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his proper action: (as the odours doe referre themſelues to the particular Inſtrument of ſmelling: and that which is heard, to the Eares; and the Specters, to the Eyes:) then ſhall any man thinke that he ſeeth, heareth, or ſmelleth ſomething, without that any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect doth truly preſent it ſelf to the ſight, to the hearing or ſmelling. And as touching the ſenſe of ſeeing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be ſo, that the viſion be no other thing then a
<pb facs="tcp:8919:44"/>perceiuing of ſome ſhape which is made within the liuely chryſtall of the eyes; which wee call the Ball or Apple of the eye. Certainely whether it bee ſo, that ſome obiect doth preſent it ſelfe to the ſight, or not, but is onely imagined, yet it appeareth, that the partie doth perfectly and aſſuredly ſee ſomething. And ſo likewiſe euen in wakening, it happeneth that ſome ſee Diuels and dead men: and ſometimes they ſuppoſe that they heare the voyce of them who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they once knew: and that they ſmell certaine ſents and perfumes: yea, more then that, that many times they doe feele and touch ſuch things, as appeareth by thoſe which are troubled with the <hi>Inoubae</hi> and <hi>Succubae,</hi> or the <hi>Nightmare.</hi> How beit theſe imagined formes are more ſeldome and rarely ſeene, then they are either heard, ſmelt, or touched, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in all the other ſenſes, ſaue in the ſight only, it is not needefull to obſerue any more then one onely difference. And therefore one onely Spirit transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the ſenſe, together with the thing that is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, will very eaſily repreſent the ſame. But to the eyes there are many differences neceſſarie, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the forme, the colour: and therefore it muſt bee of neceſſitie, that many Spirites be transferred thereunto. Beſides thoſe Sinewes that appertaine to the eyes, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath made them hollow: And they only of all the other ſenſes are ſo, becauſe they haue need of many ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in their operations. And it happeneth, that wee are ſooner wearied in looking and beholding atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon any thing, then we are in the vſing and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of any other of the bodily ſenſes whatſoeuer.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the very wordes and reaſons which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerrois</hi> vſeth,<note place="margin">Anſwere to the Argument of Auerrois.</note> in confirmation of his opinion: To the which it is eaſie to anſwere, by ſaying, that the great I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination of men, being bent and ſet vpon any thing by earneſt ſpeculation, may well alter and hurt a little the operation and force of the minde and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. But that the ſame can make or cauſe a man to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8919:44"/>ſee any Specters of a mouing and a liuing nature: and (more then ſo) to touch, to heare, or to ſmell any thing of a vaine and phantaſmaticall nature, vnleſſe the ſame happen by the operation of the Diuell, and that alſo very extraordinarily: This ſhall not <hi>Auerrois</hi> make me to beleeue. For it was neuer yet ſeene, heard, nor appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that ſuch a thing could befall in the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, except it were onely to ſuch men, as had their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſo decayed and periſhed, &amp; their imaginatiue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſo weakened and corrupted, as the vnderſtanding did therby reſt not onely hindred in his operation, but altogether dulled and darkened.<note place="margin">In Libro. de Somno &amp; Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</note> And well ſaith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle, that it must of neceſſitie be a great and ſtrange paſsion, when in waking the ſenſe is ſo peruerted, that it ſuffereth it ſelfe to be guided and moued by the ſame:</hi> Nay, let it be, that this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie (where of <hi>Auerrois</hi> ſpeaketh) be not a paſsion, but a verie naturall and ſound imagination (whereunto they which be of a melancholike humor, and the wiſe Philoſophers are ſubiect): who (as <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> in one of his Comedies writeth of them) doe ſcale or clime the heauens, and doe flye aboue the Sunne by their liuely contemplation: yet neuertheleſſe for all that, they do not any thing the ſooner either ſee, or heare, ſmell, or touch, any Specters: Howſoeuer ſometimes they may haue their mindes ſo ſubiect to the Imagination, that they remaine as men aſtoniſhed and vnmoueable. But it is not neceſſarie, that all whatſoeuer one imagineth by the ſenſes, ſhould incontinently fall into them ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly. And there is a very great difference in the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination which is internall, and the Action of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which are externall. And yet I will eaſily agree to that ſaying of <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> 
                  <q>That naturally,<note place="margin">De Somno et Vigilia.</note> euen in the ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:8919:45"/>formes and Images which they dreamed of. And this happeneth often to yong perſons, who of a ſudden are ſo frighted, that they thinke they ſee many vaine Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and figures, that for very feare they hide themſelues vnder the couerings of their beddes.</q> But ſuch feares doe not laſt nor continue long, but as ſoone as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is throughly and wel wakened, they do vaniſh away from the fantaſie, which had before apprehended and receiued them vainely and falſely.<note place="margin">The opinion &amp; reaſons of Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, touching Spirits and Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, that they are but an Imagin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And this may ſerue very well to refute that diſcourſe of <hi>Caſſius</hi> the <hi>Epicure,</hi> who would needes perſwade <hi>Brutus</hi> his Companion (as <hi>Plutareh</hi> writeth) that the Specter which he ſawe with his bodily eyes, not in ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, but in waking) was but a falſe Imagination.

Moreouer, our I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination is ſharpe, prompt, and of a liuely diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to moue our ſenſes, and to make or build any forme vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſubiect, which in truth ſhal be none at all. For the Imagination is like vnto waxe, and is very facile &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the mind of man, which doth faine vnto it ſelfe al things, and doth varie and compoſe in it ſelfe one and the ſame thing diuerſly: as is euident by the often chaunges of Dreames, which in a very ſhort moment the fantaſie doth turne and alter into diuers kindes of formes and ſhapes. To be in continuall motion, is a thing not abhorring from the nature of the minde of man: now the motion thereof is but a certaine fantaſie or a kinde of intelligence. And as touching thy ſelfe (O <hi>Brutus</hi>) thou art of a Melancholike nature: which is the cauſe that thy vnderſtanding is alwayes diuerted and lifted vp to contemplation. And as concerning the Diuels or Spirites, it is verie credible that there are

And yet hee is more Religious then are either the <hi>Epicures</hi> or the <hi>Peripatetikes,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them altogether. But as concerning that which hee ſaith of the Imagination, and of the falſe perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſenſes, hee declareth ſufficiently, that hee would not that a man ſhould beleeue himſelf: ſeeing ee will not beleeue that which hee ſeeth certainly with his eyes: how beit the ſight be one of the moſt certaine ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that a man hath, &amp; which of al the others is leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.

Wherefore the heaven being a naturall Agent, and having many things neere adioyning vnto it: It muſt needes be, that it muſt worke many effects: Of the which, the one is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the certaine ſigne of the other; albeit many of them doe never take effect, nor can be knowne what they be. And foraſmuch as of great events, it muſt needes be that the cauſes be ſtrong and forcible, ſo contrariwiſe, where the cauſes are powerful &amp; puiſſant, the effects alſo muſt of neceſſitie be admirable; becauſe in nature the cauſes are ever anſwerable to the effects. It is therefore no mervaile if the heaven do produce Specters, and ſuch like micacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous effects, it having ſuch power over the inferior Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to their ſecond Argument.</note>But this argument may bee ſoone aunſwered in two words: That the influence of the heavens doth worke by the will of God, many things that are ſtrange and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and yet ſuch nevertheleſſe as are naturall: But that the heavens haue the power to worke above nature, and ſo to produce Specters, that can in no wiſe be granted nor admitted; becauſe Nature it ſelfe is contrary therevnto: the which ought firſt to be regarded and conſidered as the cauſe, before wee can admit or allow of her effects. Thus you ſee how eaſily all the reaſons of the Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques are refuted and overthrowne, how ſtrong ſoever they ſeeme to be made, to proove ſuch power in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.

               </p>
               <p>Their firſt argument is, that the Art <hi>Magike,</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8919:49"/>but meerely vaine and falſe. But the intention of <hi>Magike,</hi> is held to be principally of and by the Divells. Therefore the Divells are not at all, but are a vaine and falſe thing.</p>
               <p>To this argument I anſwere: That trew it is that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gike</hi> is a vaine Science and prohibited;<note place="margin">Anſwer to their firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnment.</note> that the effects thereof are full of abuſe and ſcandalous. But that the <hi>Art Magicke</hi> is nothing, and that the divells can not worke by it, by the meanes of <hi>Magicians</hi> and Sorcerers, is no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their ſecond Argument.</note>Their ſecond argument is, that if there be divells, then they have a ſoule and members neceſſary to execute and performe the functions of the ſoule, as wee ſee in living creatures. And to the end that ſuch things ſhould conſiſt and be, the divells muſt of neceſſitie have a more ſolide and firme element then the ayre, to wit, the water or the earth, where it behooveth them to abide and remaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to their ſecond Argument.</note>But this argument is of no ſorce: for I deny that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary the divells ſhould have a body; and admit they doe make a ſhew of one when they appeare vnto vs: yet that followeth not that they have ſuch a one of their own nature; but they do fit and accommodate themſelves to our ſenſes, taking vnto them a body of an ayrie ſubtile and thin ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their third Argument.</note>Their third argument is, that if it bee graunted there bee Divelles, it is principally in reſpect of Specters: But the Specters are vaine, or come, for the moſt parte, of the ſecret cauſes of the Heavens, or of Nature: and therefore all that which is ſaid of divells is meerely falſe and vntrue.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to their third Argument.</note>To this argument we neede not make any anſwer, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have before ſufficiently ſatisfied them in this point.</p>
               <p>Their fourth Argument is, that it is not probable there ſhould be any divells in that ſpatious emiptie circuit of the ayre, or in the earth: becauſe,<note place="margin">Their fourth Argument.</note> if they be in ſo great a number as it is affirmed that they are, they might be then as thicke, and in as great a multitude, as the birds of the
<pb facs="tcp:8919:50"/>ayre: and ſo every place would be full of Specters, ſpirits, divells: which would yeelde divers feares and terrours vnto men. But that is not ſo: For hardly ſhall a man ſee in the ſpace of twenty yeares, that in any Province any Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters do appeare and preſent themſelves: and when they do at any time ſhew themſelves, it may be attributed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Nature. Again they adde this reaſon, that if there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells, they ſhould be either friends or enemies vnto men: if enemies, then ſome ſhould be hurt and offended by them, eſpecially ſuch as make a mocke and ieaſt at them and their eſſence: as namely the <hi>Epicures,</hi> the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> and the <hi>Peripatetiques:</hi> But we never heard that any of all theſe (for contemning of them) have bin any thing the more vexed or tormented. And in very deede they are of ſo thinne and ſubtile a ſubſtaunce, as they can not huit them. And yet this is nothing to the purpoſe. For what ſhould hinder them but that they may caſt and hurle about tiles and brickes, and ſo hurt men downe from aloft, or from the toppes of mountaines: or that they ſhould not, like a Gad-bee or Horſe-fly light vpon the tailes of mens hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſo to cauſe them to be caſt off, &amp; to tumble to the ground, ſeeing we do beleeve that they have the power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to tempt men in their ſoules?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to their fourth argument.</note>But this Argument is ridiculous, and it is needleſſe to make anſwere there vnto: ſave that a man may pay the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatetiques</hi> with the ſame mony, in telling them: That the divels are in a region of the ayre, ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this of ours. from whence they cannot iſſue forth, either to harm vs, or to appeare vnto vs: no more then an infinite number of Sea-monſters, the which do but verie ſeldome ſhew them ſelves vnto vs. And if peradventure they doe ſometimes hurt and annoy vs: it is no otherwiſe then as we do endo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage the fiſhes of the ſea, which are in another Element then this that we are in.

               <p>As concerning thoſe of ſepulchres, he ſayth; That natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a man may ſee out of them certaine ſhadowes, which by way of impreſſion, doe referre and make ſhew of the viſage, the port, and the greatneſſe of thoſe that have been there buried and enterred in no great depth within the ground: And his words are theſe; <q>That the carcaſes being yet moiſt and freſh, may ſend forth of the earth a kinde of ſhadow which ſhall repreſent their ſhape and likeneſſe.</q> Wherevnto I ſay, that the corps or bodies which are newly dead, have their pores ſtopt and ſhut vp: ſo as they cannot yeelde any exhalation from them, but onely when they come to putrefaction: I do not ſay but that they may caſt from them by the naturall condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its a certaine putrefied humour. But that cannot make any entire ſhadowe, much leſſe may a man affirme, that when they are putrified, they can evaporate any thing which may reſemble their forme and ſhape. <hi>For from an entire and whole body, an entyre and whole ſhadow ought to be made.</hi> But the bodies which are putrified are not entire, but beginne to diſſolve and to be reduced into duſt or aſhes.

By reaſon whereof, the ſpirites of the people doe become verie groſſe &amp; dull, partly in regard of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living, and of the ayre, and partly in reſpect of the nature of the ſoyle, and by meanes of the extreame cold that there exceedeth. And thereof it proceedeth that for the thickneſſe of the aire, &amp; for the vapours which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred by reaſon of the colde, many images and formes are ſeene wandring and ſtraying here and there: the which the feare, and imagination, &amp; the weaknes of the braine in the inhabitants, doth conceive and retaine even ſo long till they come to fall vnder the ſenſe of the ſight, which ſuffereth it ſelfe to be perſwaded, that they are true formes and ſhapes in verie deed.

                  <note place="margin">Anſvver to the latter reaſon of <hi>Cardan.</hi>
                  </note> is not ſo barren and vnfruitfull as he reporteth it: neither are the inhabitants ſo poore and miſerable, as that they do live of nothing but of meale of fiſh-bones, in ſtead of bread. Thoſe that have beene in this Iſle, doe report no ſuch matter. And as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the nature of this ſoyle, being full of a kind of pitch of the nature of Sulphre, or Brimſtone: I beleeve <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> in that poynt: but yet that the bad and corrupt fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and nouriture of vnwholſome &amp; groſſe nutriments, or that this pitch it ſelfe can ſo thicken the ayre, &amp; the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive ſpirits in ſuch ſort, as a man ſhould imagine himſelfe to ſee, touch, &amp; embrace ſpirits &amp; ſpecters: that is beyond my knowledge. I make no doubt but that herbes and rootes being taken without any other nutritive ſubſtance: and thoſe meates that are of evill digeſtion to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, or doe carrie a ſtrong ſavour in the mouth, as
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8919:55"/>Onions, Garlike, and ſuch like things doe thicken and corrupt the ayre, ſo as it may cauſe infection: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of commeth the Proverb; <hi>That after a Famine, commeth the Peſtilence.</hi> For the poore people not having bread to feede vpon, doe ſuſtaine and noriſh themſelves with ſuch infectious victualls: And then when the Sunne hath hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ayre, and being at the height, doth ſhoote and pierce into the bowells of the earth, (as <hi>Homer</hi> termeth it,) and doth make vs to feele the force of her ſcorching beames and parching heate. Then incontinently doth the Peſtilence alſo beginne to grow hote by the infection of the ayre, which is before infected by the corrupt feeding of the people. Moreover I know well that Brimſtone and Sulphre do thicken the ayre; inſomuch as the birds ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times flying over it, do ſodainely fall downe dead. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe (as I have already ſaid,) I cannot conceive, that by reaſon of bread and ill feeding, or by vertue of the ſoile partaking of ſulphre, a man ſhould ſee any Specters, and thoſe falſe and imaginative onely: For the land of <hi>Iewry</hi> (where the like kinde of pitch or ſulphre groweth in the lake <hi>Aſphaltites,</hi> doth not complaine of ſeeing any Spectes, as the <hi>Iſlanders</hi> doe. And if ſuch pitch or ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous ſoyle, ſhould cauſe the generation of Specters, aſſuredly they would appeare and ſhew themſelves more eaſily in the land of <hi>Iewry,</hi> then in <hi>Iſland:</hi> becauſe in <hi>Iewry</hi> the ayre is more warme and of much more heate then in <hi>Iſeland,</hi> where the windes do carry a great ſway: The which will ſoone diſſipate and ſcatter all figures created in a groſſe and thicke ayre, ſo as they ſhall not have any leaſure to forme and ſhape themſelves. For there muſt of neceſſitie be ſuch an ayre as may bee warme and milde, without any windes, that ſhould cauſe them to ſtay and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide ſo long, that a man may exactly diſcerne them as Specters. And this is a thing moſt cleere and manifeſt, that the winter and the colde are ſo farre from making the ayre warme or thicke, that they do rather make it cleere, pure, and ſubtile. Laſt of all, I will ſay this more, that if the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
<pb facs="tcp:8919:56"/>do proceede in <hi>Iſeland,</hi> by reaſon of the ayre which is perpetually thicke and groſſe there in that Countrey. We muſt conclude alſo, that the Specters there, ſhould be perpetuall likewiſe. But the <hi>Iſelanders</hi> do not ſee any but very ſeldome, and that but once onely in their whole life time: How then is it poſſible that the ayre ſhould bee the cauſe of their generation?</p>
               <p>But let vs admit all theſe reaſons of <hi>Cardan</hi> together with their abſurdities, and let vs ſee what anſwer he will make to his owne obiection; in that he affirmeth how theſe Specters do ſpeake and talke vnto men, ſaying; That they go to the mountaine <hi>Herlu.</hi> Is the pitch or ſulpher in that ſoyle the cauſe thereof; or is it cauſed by the thicke and groſſe ayre, or by the nuriture and feeding of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants? Can the ſenſe of hearing be offended and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as well as the ſight, by meanes of the ayre, that it ſhould enter within the cartilage or griſtle of the care, and that it ſhould carry by the empty paſſage thereof e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the braine, diſtinct and plaine ſounding voyces, and yet ſuch as ſhould notwithſtanding be falſe and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined? Truly theſe reaſons are farre vnworthy and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming a man any thing (though never ſo little) ſeene or exerciſed in Philoſophy: much more ſo great a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher and Phiſitian as <hi>Cardan</hi> was. Nevertheleſſe I am of the opinion that <hi>Cardan</hi> did not erre in Philoſophie through ignorance, but having a deſire continually to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare more learned, he did ever bend himſelfe to impugne that which hee knew the ſoundeſt and beſt part of men did hold and maintain. And amongſt other things he did ever ſhew a minde and diſpoſition in the greateſt part of his bookes, to call in doubt and queſtion the apparition of Specters: In the which notwithſtanding he doth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velouſly repugne and contrary himſelfe, not knowing if there were any ſpecters, or if there were none; ſomtimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the authority of <hi>Pſellus,</hi> &amp; ſometimes that of <hi>Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Cardanus,</hi> his owne father: (Both which did conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintaine the Specters and Apparitions of divells, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8919:56"/>eſpecially <hi>Facius Cardanus,</hi> who had not onely one ſpirit and familiar, but ſeaven, all at one time, which did reveale vnto him and acquaint him plainely with many ſtrange and goodly mervailes:) and ſometimes affirming that all whatſoever was ſpoken and reported of the Apparition of ſpirits and Specters, was nothing elſe but ieaſts, tales, and leaſings. But this ſhall ſuffice for the diſcuſſing of <hi>Cardan,</hi> his reaſons and opinions.

               <head type="sub">Of the Arguments of thoſe which deny that the Angells and Divells can take vnto them a Bodie.</head>
               <p>THey which doe deny that the Angells and divells can take vnto them a body, do not ayme at the marke to deny their eſſence, (as do the <hi>Saduces:</hi>) but they doe it onely to diſprove and impugne their Apparition. For it is a good conſequent; If the Angells and divells take not vpon them any body, then can they not appeare: And if one ſhould reply vnto them and ſay; That in our ſpirit and vnderſtanding the Angells and divells may give ſome ſhew and token of their preſence. To this they have their exception readie: That things ſpirituall and intelligible, and all ſorts of intelligences, doe repreſent themſelves by things that are ſenſible. Wee will ſee therefore by what reaſons they indevour to proove,<note place="margin">Firſt objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to proove that Angells and divells cannot take vnto them a body.</note> that an Angell or a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell cannot take a body vnto them?</p>
               <p>No body (ſay they,) can be vnited to an incorporall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but onely that it may have an eſſence and a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the meanes of that ſubſtance. But the Angells and diuells cannot have a body vnited in regard of any eſſence:
<pb facs="tcp:8919:57"/>for in ſo doing we muſt conclude, that their bodies ſhould be naturally vnited vnto them, which is altogither vntrue: and therefore it remayneth that they cannot be vnited vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a bodie, but onely in regard of the motion: which is a reaſon of no ſufficiencie for the approving of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. For thereof would follow an abſurditie in regarde of the Angels: to wit, That they might take all thoſe bodies that are moved by them, which is a verie great and groſſe errour. For the Angell did move the tongue of <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſſe: and yet he entred not in his tongue. And therefore it cannot be ſaid that an Angell, or a Divell, can take a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwere to the firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, or obiection.</note>To this Argument I anſwere, That true it is, that an Angell and a Divell, cannot (to ſpeake properly) take vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them every bodie that is moved: For to take a bodie ſignifieth to adhere vnto the bodie. Now the Angels and the Divels do take vnto them a bodie, not to vnite it to their nature, and to incorporate it together with their eſſence: as hee that taketh any kinde of meate for ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: much leſſe to vnite the ſame to their perſon: as the ſonne of God tooke vpon him the humane nature: But they doe it onely, that they may viſibly repreſent themſelves vnto the ſight of men. And in this ſort the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels &amp; Divels are ſaid to take a bodie, ſuch as is apt &amp; fit for their apparition,<note place="margin">Cap. <hi>15.</hi> caleſt. Hierachiae.</note> as appeareth by the authoritie of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys Ariopagyte,</hi> who writeth, <q>that by the corporal forms the properties of Angels are knowne and diſcerned.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond Argument.</note>Againe they ſay, That if the Angels and Divels doe take a bodie, it is not for any neceſſitie that they have, but onely to inſtruct and exhort vs to live well, as do the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; or to deceive and deſtroy vs, as do the Divels. Now both to the one and the other, the imaginarie viſion, or the tentation is ſufficient: and therefore it ſeemeth, that it is not needfull they ſhould take veto them any bodie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to the ſecond Argument.</note>I anſwere: that not onely the imaginarie viſion of Angels is neceſſary for our inſtruction, but that alſo which is corporall and bodily, as we ſhall ſhow anone, when we
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:8919:57"/>intreate of the Apparition of Angels. And as concerning the Divels, God doth permit them both viſibly and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to tempt vs, ſome to their ſalvation, and ſome to their damnation.</p>
               <p>Moreover they thus argue:<note place="margin">The third Argument. <hi>Li.</hi> 3. ca. 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.</note> That God appeared vnto the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> (as is to be ſeene in the old Teſtament, and the good Angels likewiſe,) as <hi>Saint Auguſtine proveth</hi> in his Bookes of the <hi>Trimitie.</hi> Now wee may not ſay, that God tooke vpon him any body, except onely in that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of his Incarnation. And therefore it is needleſſe to affirme, that the Angels which appeare vnto men, may take vpon them a bodie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to their third Argument.</note>I anſwere, (as doth <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi>) who ſayth: That all the apparitions which were in the olde Teſtament, were made by the miniſterie of Angels, who formed and ſhaped vnto themſelves certaine ſhapes and figures ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarie and corporall, by which they might reduce and drawe vnto God, the ſoule and ſpirite of him that ſawe them: as it is poſſible; that by figures which are ſenſible, men may be drawne and lifted vp in ſpirit and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation vnto God. And therefore wee may well ſay, that the Angels did take vnto them a bodie, when they appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in ſuch apparitions. But now God is ſayde to have appeared; becauſe God was the butte and marke, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto by viſion of thoſe bodies, the Angels did endevour and ſeeke to lift vp vnto God the ſoules of men. And this is the cauſe that the Scripture ſayth, That in theſe Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions ſometimes God appeared, and ſometimes the Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their fourth Argument.</note>Furthermore, they make this obiection: Like as it is agreeing naturally to the ſoule to be vnited to the bodie: ſo, not to be vnited vnto a bodie, is proper and naturall vnto the Angels and Divels. Now the ſoule cannot bee ſeparated from the bodie when it will: Therefore the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Divels alſo cannot take vnto them a bodie when they will.</p>
               <p>For anſwere whereof, I confeſſe that everie thing
<pb facs="tcp:8919:58"/>borne and ingendred hath not any power over his being:<note place="margin">Anſwer to their fourth Argument.</note> for all the power of any thing floweth from the eſſence thereof, or preſuppoſeth an eſſence: And becauſe the ſoule by reaſon of her being, is vnited vnto the body, as the forme thereof: it is not in her puiſſance to deliver herſelfe from the vnion of the body. And ſo in like manner it is not in the power of any Angell or divell to vnite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any body as the forme thereof: but they may well take a body whereof they may be the mooving cauſe, and (if a man may ſo ſpeake,) as the figure of the figure.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their fiſt Argument.</note>They affirme moreover, that betweene the body aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, (if I may vſe this word,) and the party aſſuming, there ought to be ſome proportion and ſimilitude: But betweene an Angell or divell, and a body, there is not any proportion; for both the one and the other are of divers kindes, and by conſequent both of them are incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to their fiſt Argument.</note>To this I anſwer, That if the proportion be taken accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the quantitie, greatnes, &amp; meaſure, there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betweene the Angells or divells, &amp; a body; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their greatneſſe is not of one and the ſame kinde, nor of one and the ſame conſideration. Notwithſtanding nothing can let but that there may be a certaine habitude of an Angell to a body: as of a thing that mooveth to the motion, and of a thing figured to the figure, the which may be termed a proportion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſixt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note>Another Argument they make which is this: No ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance finite (whatſoever it be) can have many operations together: An Angell is a ſubſtance finite; and therefore it cannot both miniſter vnto vs, and take to it ſelfe a body together.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to their fixt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note>But this is eaſily diſſolved, for I ſay, that theſe two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations: To take a body, and to ſerve in their miniſterie are ordained mutually to the Angells: And therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hindreth them, but that the Angells may vſe both of them at once,<note place="margin">Their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and together.</p>
               <p>Againe they inferre, that if Angells and divells do take
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8919:58"/>a body, eyther it is a <hi>Celestiall Body,</hi> or ſome other having <hi>the nature of ſome of the foure Elements.</hi> Now the Angells cannot take a <hi>Celeſtiall Body,</hi> for that the Body of the heaven cannot devide it ſelfe, nor cannot make any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction from it ſelfe: much leſſe can the divells have that power, ſeeing the Angells have it not. Beſides, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take vnto them a body of <hi>Fire,</hi> for then they ſhould conſume and burne the bodie, neere to which they doe approach: much leſſe can they take a body of the <hi>Ayre,</hi> for that is not figurable: neyther can they take any bodie that is a moveable Element, and retaineth no forme; nor yet by the ſame meane, can they have a <hi>Terreſtriall</hi> bodie; for we ſee it written how the Angels do very ſoone &amp; ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly vaniſh away out of ſight, as it appeared by that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel which came to <hi>Tobias.</hi> And the divels alſo when they ſhew themſelves in any aparition, can in a moment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelues from the ſight of men. And therefore being vnable and vnapt to take vpon them any body, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Elementarie or Celeſtiall: It muſt needes follow that they appeare not at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to their ſeaventh Argument.</note>To this I anſwer, That the Angells and divells may take a body of any Element whatſoever, and which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will; yea, and of many Elements mixt together. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe it is moſt likely to be true, and the common opinion is;<note place="margin">What kinde of body An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells &amp; divells take vnto them when they appeare.</note> that they doe ſooneſt of all take vnto them a bodie of the ayre, by thickning the ſame and forming it of vapors, that mount and ariſe from the earth, and in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and mooving it at their pleaſure, as the winde moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the clowds, being able to make the ſame to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare and vaniſh away againe whenſoever they will, by reaſon that it is nothing but a vapor.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their eight Argument.</note>But yet this will not ſatisfie them, but they go further ſaying; That every aſſumption of a body, is limited and bounded with ſome Vnion: But of an Angel and of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, there cannot be made any of thoſe <hi>Three meanes of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> of which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaketh: For they cannot bee made one by <hi>Continuation,</hi> by <hi>Inſeparabilitie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> Phiſico.</note> nor by <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8919:59"/>
               <p>To this a man may anſwer as before, That there is not any vnion in the aſſumption of a body by an Angel. For if there were a vnion, then in truth that which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaketh, ſhould bee requiſite betweene the Angel and the body which it aſſumeth. But there is not betweene them any vnion, ſave onely that which is of a thing moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the thing mooved, as wee have before affirmed.</p>
               <p>Againe, the good Angells (ſay they) in appearing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, eyther do take <hi>True Figures viſible and palpable,</hi> or ſuch as are altogether Falſe.<note place="margin">Their ninth Argument.</note> If they have ſuch as be True, it ſhould then follow, that if they appeare in a humane body, then they do aſſume a <hi>True humane body:</hi> But this is impoſſible, vnleſſe we ſhould ſay; That an Angell may enter into the body of a man, which is a thing not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient nor agreeable vnto the Angelicall Nature. And if they have <hi>Falſe Figures,</hi> this would be much more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting and vnbeſeeming them, for that all feyning and diſſembling, or any kinde of fiction is very vnſeemely in the Angells of Truth.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to their ninth Argument.</note>To this obiection I anſwer, That the bodies which the Angells do take, have <hi>True and vnfeyned formes ſo farre forth, as they may be ſeene and perceived by the ſenſes, be it in their colour or their Figure,</hi> but <hi>not according to the nature of their kinde:</hi> For that cannot become ſenſible but by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident. That therefore is no cauſe why a man ſhould ſay, that there is any fiction and feyning in the Angells: for they do not oppoſe &amp; ſet before our eyes humane ſhapes and formes, becauſe thereby they would bee thought and eſteemed to be men: but to the end that by their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane properties, we ſhould know the vertues of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells. And like as <hi>Metaphorras</hi> ſpeeches are not therefore any whit the ſooner to be reputed falſe, in which by the ſimilitude of things, other ſignifications are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: So the figures and formes of Angells are not falſe, becauſe they are taken and aſſumed to the ſimilitude and

               <p>More then ſo (they reply) that the Angells and divells by the vertue of their Nature,<note place="margin">Their tenth Argument.</note> cannot worke or create any effects within humane bodies, ſave only by the meanes of their naturall vertues. But their naturall vertues cannot be in things corporall to forme any Figure of a humane body, but onely by the vſuall and determined meane of generation, to wit, by the ſeede naturally ordayned to that effect: in which ſort the Angells and divells cannot take a body vpon them. And the ſame reaſon and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is there of other figures, of carthly bodies alſo which they take vnto them.</p>
               <p>But heerevnto this anſwer may be made them, That albeit the naturall vertues of a body,<note place="margin">Anſwer to their tenth Argument.</note> do not ſuffice to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a true ſhape of a humane body, but onely by the due and ordinary meane of generation: Nevertheleſſe ſo it is, that the Angells and divells are capable to clothe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to put on a certaine ſimilitude of humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, as touching the colour and figure, and other ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Accidents, and that eſpecially at ſuch a time, as when it may ſuffice them by a locall motion, to moove any ſuch bodies; by meanes whereof, both the vapors are thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and againe purefied and made thin; as alſo the clowds are diverſly painted and figured.</p>
               <p>But they obiect againe, that this is not ſufficient: But (they ſay) that it behooveth the cauſe,<note place="margin">A reply to the former an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</note> mooving to infuſe ſome vertue into the body mooved, but cannot infuſe any vertue, except it touch it.

               <p>Herevnto I anſwere, That the commaundement of the Angell doth demaund an execution of his vertue and puiſſance: and therefore it muſt of neceſſitie bee, that there be ſome ſpirituall touching of that bodie by which it is moved.</p>

                  <note place="margin">8. <hi>Phiſicorum.</hi> Arguments vrging that angels cannot move bodies with a locall motion.</note>Their firſt Argument is taken from the authoritie of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who ſayth: That the locall motion is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall, and moſt perfect of all other motions.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond reaſon.</note>Their ſecond Argument is; That the locall motion of naturall bodies doth follow their formes: But the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are not cauſes of the formes of naturall bodies, and therefore they cannot be a meane to give them any locall motion.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The third reaſon.</note>Their third Argument is: That the corporall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers do obey to the conception of the ſoule in a locall motion, in aſmuch as they have from her the beginning of life: now the bodies which the Angels take vnto them, have not from them the beginning of life: for then it would behoove that the bodies and the Angels ſhould be vnited togither.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to the third reaſon.</note>I anſwere, That the Angels have their vertue leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned or hindred then the ſoules, inſomuch that being ſeparated from all corporall maſſineſſe, they may never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe take an ayrie bodie, the which they can move lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally at their will and pleaſure.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Their tvvelfth Argument.</note>Beſides all the former Arguments, they replie yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſay: That everie corporall motion doth not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey to the commaund of the Angels, as touching the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and faſhioning thereof: now the figure which the angels take, is as a kinde of forme.

               <p>To this the anſwere is, That the figure which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8919:61"/>not having eyther hands to touch withall, or feete to goe on, or tongue to ſpeake with; except ſuch onely as the divell did ſeeme to give vnto it by his deceitfull illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to their four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>To this argument anſwer may be made in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; That the Angell or divell ſo taking any body vpon him, is wholy in the whole body which it aſſumeth, or elſe in a part thereof, as the ſoule is in the body. For albeit he be not the forme of the body which it aſſumeth, as is the ſoule; yet ſo it is, that he is the moover thereof. Now it behooveth that the moover and the thing mooved, ſhould be together: And it is nothing to the purpoſe to ſay, that an Angell or divell, filling a body whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre of ſubſtance, can be in divers places: for the whole body aſſumed by an Angell or divell, is not but in one place onely, albeit the ſame be admitted to have many members and many parts.</p>
               <p>Thus farre have I done my beſt, both to ſet downe and to refute all the reaſons and arguments obiected by thoſe who deny that Angells and divells can aſſume and take vnto them a body: to the intent that from hence forth their mouths might be ſtopped, and that they may

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Rabbins, touching the Apparitions mentioned in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</note>But before I come to conclude this diſcourſe, I may not forget to tell you how that many of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> and <hi>Iewes</hi> which have taken vpon them to interpret the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, have held opinion and beene of the beliefe, that thoſe Angells which appeared to the <hi>Patriarkes</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> did not appeare in any body, nor did aſſume vnto them any body to make themſelves viſible.

But this poſition (as Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin</hi> calleth it,<note place="margin">The: Aquin queſt: de Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calis Arti. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note>) cannot prevaile againſt the truth of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: for by the phraſe and manner of ſpeeches which are vſuall in the bookes of the old Teſtament, it is eaſie to know and diſcerne a difference that which is ſignified and declared to have <hi>Appeared purely and ſimply to our eyes,</hi> from that which is ſaid to bee done by the meanes of a <hi>Propheticall viſion.</hi> For when it ought to be vnderſtood<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, that any Apparition was made by way of viſion, there are ſome words put downe and inſert, which doe properly appertaine to the viſion, ſuch as the Scriptures do intend; as in <hi>Ezechiel,<note place="margin">Ezechiel ce. 8.</note> the ſpirit of the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>lifted me vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the heaven, and the earth, &amp; led me into</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>by the viſions of the Lord.</hi> I ſay therefore, that when it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that things are ſaid to be done ſimply, wee ought to vnderſtand them as done ſimply and truly. Now we reade in the old Teſtament, that many Apparitions have beene made in body: And therefore we ought to grant, that the Angells do ſometimes aſſume and take vnto them a body, in forming ſuch a body as is ſenſible and ſubiect to the externall and corporall viſion, as well as ſome kinde of ſhapes do forme themſelves in our imagination, which do produce an imaginative viſion when wee are ſleeping.

                  <hi>Sextus</hi> the Philoſopher who was one of this Sect, hath written a very large volume, wherein he aſſayeth to maintaine the opinion of <hi>Pirrhon</hi> by the authority of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny auncient Philoſophers and Poets: and to ſhew by lively demonſtrations and arguments, That the ſight, the hearing, the ſmelling, and other the humane ſenſes are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to be deceived, be they never ſo ſound: and that wee doe neither imagine nor take an opinion of any thing, but falſely and inconſiderately.</p>

And as it is moſt ſure and certaine that the Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are incomprehenſible in nature: ſo is not poſſible for any man to give any demonſtration or iudgement of them. For thoſe thinges of which demonſtration may be made, have a ſubſtance, certaine, comprehenſible and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured to be ſuch; which cannot be ſaide of Specters. The which even amongſt the dogmaticall Philoſophers (who were moſt earneſt maintainers of that opinion is certaine) were called in doubt: as namely by the Peripatetiques, who of all other Philoſophers being the moſt dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and opinionative, did wholy impugne and deny the being of any Specters.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond argument of the Sceptikes. That the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of the vncertainetie, and variety of the accidents in man, which being knowne by the ſenſes doe cauſe in them diverſe and different imaginations and effects.</note>But (will the <hi>Sceptiques</hi> now ſay) The ſenſes can not ſee or diſcerne any thing in truth: and how is it then poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that vpon an obiect falſely conceived, a man may ground his iudgement and maintaine the eſſence thereof; But now let vs ſee what they alleadge for the regard of the ſenſes. It is moſt certaine (ſay they) that the ſenſes do not comprehend any thing but by th'accidents; Of the which the eſſence is vncertaine and variable according vnto the ſubiects wherein they offer themſelves to be ſeene: For we ſee that in following the vncertaintie of the accidents, there are to be marked and obſerved divers imaginations fantaſies and natures in creatures, of which the ſenſes doe'
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8919:65"/>comprehend and perceive ſome things either more or leſſe in them: as the Eagle hath her ſight more cleere then all other birdes: and the dogge hath his noſthrilles more ſubtile to ſmell, and to take the ſent of any thing, far more excellent than any other beaſt whatſoever. Contrariwiſe the Owle ſeeth not at all, but only in the night: and there are many creatures which can ſmell little or nothing at all. And this proceedeth not of any other thing than of the accidents, which being divers and different in creatures, dooth make their imaginative powers to be as divers and different likewiſe. That this is ſo, and that the accidents do preſent themſelves in creatures according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of their condition or diſpoſition. It appeareth even amongeſt men, who according as they ſhall finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſpoſed, ſo will they alwayes imagine the thinges that are preſent. As thoſe that have a fever, doe iudge all things to be hote: and to them that have their tongue or taſte diſtemperd by meanes of any fever wherewith they are aggreeved: all meates doe ſeeme to be exceeding bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and ſo is it likewiſe of all other accidents wherewith men are touched, and whereof they have an imagination by their ſenſes. Inſomuch that there are found ſome men who in their ſleep walke &amp; go vp and downe, and (which is almoſt incredible) doe execute all ſuch actions as they vſe to doe when they are waking.

               <p>This diſputation thus finiſhed, touching the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents knowne and diſcerned by the Senſes: The <hi>Pirrho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> doe come next to the other part of their argument, to ſhew how eaſie the ſenſes are to be deceived.<note place="margin">Obiections of the Pir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhonians, to ſhew how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie the ſenſes are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</note> And firſt of all they bring in the ſight as the principall of all the ſenſes, which nevertheleſſe is the moſt eaſie to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. For firſt, if we will looke vnto the Sunne, which is the moſt noble Planet of all thoſe that are called wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Planets: it is not eſteemed by our ſight, to be any more then one onely foote in breadth and length: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that in truth it bee tenne times more great then the whole earth.

And what made <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (that great ſeacher of nature) to give vs ſo poore and ſimple a reaſon of the diſtance of the fixed ſtarres, but onely the vncertaintie of the ſight? was that demonſtration of his good, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he would ſhew, that the Planets were neereſt vnto vs by compariſon of the candle, the which being neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs doth not ſparkle, but being a farre off, doth ſeeme to ſparkle and twinckle? Doe we not commonly ſee the contrary to happen? But wherefore by that reaſon of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſhould not the Planets of <hi>Saturne,</hi> of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and of <hi>Mars,</hi> (which are ſo farre diſtant from vs) as well
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8919:67"/>twinckle as do the ſtarres? It behooveth therefore that we ſeeke out ſome other reaſon thereof, then by the ſight. And what maketh vs to imagine, that there is a round crowne or circle about the Moone, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is nothing elſe but a little clowde or miſt? Is it not becauſe our eye-ſight is vncertaine and cannot diſcerne it? Howbeit by the way, to this a man may ſay according to the Art <hi>Optique:</hi> That many right and perpendicular lines comming from divers parts, as well from the eye on the one ſide, as from the beames of the ſunne on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the ſide, (which is round and circuler) if they do come to encounter together and fall equally vpon one and the ſame point: This point muſt needes be the center of a circle.

The <hi>Pirrhonians</hi> doe further alleadge, that our ſight is deceived, when we thinke that an oare is broken in the water: when in ryding we ſuppoſe that the hills and mountaines do move: when a ſhrub, or the trunke and ſtub of a tree, broken and diſſevered from the boughs and branches, doth ſeeme to vs a farre off to be ſome man or ſome other quicke creature: and when a Tower of a ſquare forme do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:8919:72"/>it is not (as were the Tables of <hi>Moiſes</hi>) in the which (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were broken) a man might ſee the one halfe of the letter <hi>Samech,</hi> in the extremitie or vtmoſt part of the edge of the margent, and the other halfe might have beene ſeene in the ayre. Thoſe mirrors which are long and ſtraight, doe make the face ſtraight and round, and thoſe which belong, in a round forme, do ſhew the face long. To make ſhort, thoſe which have little round markes in them like bubbles, will ſhew as many faces, as there bee rundles in them, and for one man, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent a troope of perſons, and (as it were) a number of people. Moreover, a man may beſides theſe, make other mirrors, by the which, (not without great admiration) a man may diſcover any thing a farre off, and in the which a man may repreſent ſundry figures, beyond their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall forme. <hi>Hoſtius,</hi> (as <hi>Seneca</hi> reporteth) had certaine loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-glaſſes which ſhewed the figure of any thing farre greater then the ſame received it.<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> Natur. queſt. cap. <hi>16.</hi>

For as a man ſhall ſometimes ſee their lights ioyned all together, and ſometimes ſeperated and devided farre aſunder, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they doe either conioyne or ſeperate themſelves in ſundry bands: ſo is it with theſe lights and fierie flames appearing by night: that ſometimes they will ſeeme to gather together in a heape, and make ſhew as if there were but one bright ſhining light: and ſodainely againe, they will be diſperſed and devided aſunder each from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, making divers and ſundry lights, and as if they were vaniſhing away in ſeverall fiers, beginning to grow dimme more and more and leſſe lightſome.<note place="margin">Of the cauſe of fiery flames appearing from th'earth in the night time.</note> Theſe fierie flames (as I have ſaid) ſo wandring and running vp and downe, are not without a certaine feare and terror vnto paſſengers: howbeit a man may aſſigne vnto them a naturall cauſe why they be ſo. For the naturall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers do hold, that from the earth there doe proceede certaine thicke and groſſe exhalations, the which are ſoone and eaſily kindled and ſet on fire. That matter which is of a ſulphurious and hote nature, and lyeth hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the veines and ſecret corners of the earth: if alittle ayre do pierce thorough and come neere vnto it, on a ſuddaine it commeth to be ſet on fire, ſeeking meanes to iſſue out, and to breake forth of the earth. And doe we not ſee in certaine places of ſome countries, that the fire doth ariſe and iſſue forth of the earth in exceeding height, like vnto a great tree, and as ſuddainely againe, to be extinct and conſumed? But this is naturall, and ought to bee referred vnto the Gummie and fatte matter, which being fired, doth iſſue out of the veines of the earth, ſeeking to evaporate it ſelfe in ſome one place or other. In thoſe places where there is ſtore of Sulphre or Brimſtone (which is a kind of hot matter in the nature of mettall:) The reaſon that the fire doth not ſo ſoone die and extinguiſh it ſelfe, is, becauſe it hath a nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that doth hold on and indure with a longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8919:82"/>workemanſhip in thoſe Towers, beſides that they were neere neighbouring and adioyning one to the other, as may be gathered out of his owne writing. So likewiſe was that ſtatue or image of <hi>Memnon</hi> artificiall; the which having the face thereof turned towards the Sunne, did yeelde a reſounding noyſe: and (as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaid) the ſound that it gave, was like vnto the ſtrings of a Lute when they breake aſunder. And what ſhall wee ſay to that ſtone which was in the Tower of <hi>Megara,</hi> the which being ſtrucken on with a little ſtone or flint, did give a ſound no otherwiſe, then if it had beene an Harpe or a Lute. The ſame <hi>Pauſanias</hi> (who had travailed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Greece</hi>) and had curiouſly obſerved all the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities that were there worth the ſeeing: did marke this amongſt the reſt: and notwithſtanding hee could not finde out the reaſon thereof, but onely that it had his ground from a certaine fable, which is: that when <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thous,</hi> king of the <hi>Megarians,</hi> was purpoſed to build the walls of <hi>Megara,</hi> hee had the ayde and helpe of <hi>Apollo,</hi> who to ſet forward the worke, and labouring at it, as did other work-men, laid by his Harpe vpon a ſtone, the which ever after did retaine the ſound of an Harpe.<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>8.</hi> Metamo,</note> But <hi>Ovid</hi> writeth, that not one ſtone onely did yeelde ſuch a ſound, but that all the other ſtones and walls neere vnto a certaine Tower, did the like, And theſe are his verſes:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>There ſtands a Tower with haughtie walls encloſed,</l>
                  <l>Within the which, god <hi>Phoebus</hi> (ſo t'is noyſed,)</l>
                  <l>Did one day lay his Harpe, and ever after,</l>
                  <l>That Harpe ſweete ſound, even in the ſtones did enter.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But though <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> with <hi>Ovid</hi> likewiſe, doe take the reaſon of this marvell from an olde mouldie fable, yet ſo it is, that (if you take away the fable,) all the reſt is verie true and certaine. And we may not thinke, that <hi>Pauſani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> would have ſpoken any thing of it, if himſelfe had not ſeene the proofe and triall of it: For all the ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors

I ſay Nature: which I cannot better compare then vnto a rich Marchant, who hath in his open ſhop or ware-houſe, ſuch wares and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſes, as are common and vſuall: and in his Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine or Inner ſtore-houſe, doth keepe and lay vp his moſt rare and richeſt commodities to make ſale of the ſame to ſuch Marchants as are moſt preciſe and curious. Even ſo nature doth lay open to the world, and ſet forth many things vpon the earth; whereof ſhe is willing that every man ſhould have the knowledge: But in her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and inmoſt places, ſhe hath laid vp and hidden ſo many rare and ſtrange things, that no perſon can come to have the knowledge of them, vnleſſe he have diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeene and obſerved many and ſeverall countries: and except he have neerely and curiouſly ſounded the ſecrets of the ſame. I have heard, and am in a manner perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to beleeve it, that in the Mounts <hi>Pireney,</hi> there is a certaine mountaine, wherein if one caſt a ſtone, hee ſhall incontinently heare divers tremblings and quakings of the earth, and within a while after, he ſhall heare thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſounding add breaking out in claps, within the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and deepeſt caverns thereof, not without great feare and terror to ſundry perſons. This I wil not aſſure to be true, becauſe I have not ſeene it: but certainly I have heard the ſame credibly avowed and aſſured by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of thoſe mountainers there inhabiting, at ſuch time as I travelled that Country, neere the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of <hi>Tarbes.</hi>

And yet this cave may verie well be artificiall and made by Art, as was that Eccho of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga,</hi> and the Statue or Image of <hi>Memnon:</hi> and therefore it is the leſſe admirable. I remember that in <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> (who is held to be a verie good Author,) I have read how in the Iſle of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> called <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> there is a great Cave, ſeated at the foote of a huge mountaine, (peradventure it is Saint <hi>Patricks</hi> hole,<note place="margin">This is ſaid to be in the Peake-hills in Darbie-ſhire.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are reported ſuch marvells) within the which, when the wind entreth and is once entonneled, a man ſhall thinke that he heareth a ſound of Bells and Cimballs, the which doe ſound with often and reiterated ſtrokes in a kinde of meaſure. Beſides, the ſame Author writrth, how in <hi>Perſia,</hi> neere the Region of the <hi>Magi,</hi> there are to be ſeene three mountaines orderly diſtant one from another, and as if they had beene there planted of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in the middeſt of a large Champaine. Such as are paſſengers that way, when they are beſides the firſt mountaine, they heare a confuſed voyce of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of perſons, (as it were of ſouldiers) giving a charge or onſet in battell: And when they are at the ſecond, they heare yet a farre greater noyſe: And being at the laſt, then they heare (as it were) a great reioycing and ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of men triumphing, as if the victorie had beene got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. This, albeit it be verie admirable, yet nevertheleſſe it is naturall And <hi>Clement Alexandrine</hi> himſelfe doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme the cauſe thereof, to bee by reaſon of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavitie of the places, which maketh ſuch a noyſe to bee heard.</p>
               <p>But wee doe dwell over long vppon theſe thinges which be naturall, and in ſome ſort miraculous and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, of which, if we ſhould purſue the particularities ſuch as <hi>Plinie, Pauſanias, Strabo, Seneca; Elian, Ariſtotle,</hi> and others, (admirers of the works of Nature) have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed

The report is, that the Turkiſh Tumblers are farre more ſubtile and artificiall therein then the Italians. For be it either to tumble, to daunce vpon a corde, or by force and ſtrength of the armes, to beare and lift vp things of huge weight, ſuch as the Italians are not able ſo much as to lift from the ground, they are held to be moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert and excellent. And I have read, that in <hi>Turkie</hi> there are Tumblers which will encloſe and burie themſelves in the ground, and have nothing but a little tunnell or pipe of wood, by which they will breathe and ſpeak out of the earth. Aſſuredly theſe men may verie well by this deviſe deceive many perſons, and eſpecially if they ſhould be heard ſpeak in the night time, from vnder the ground. For what other thing coulde any man coniecture of them, but that they ſhould be ſpirits? It is a thing ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently

And <hi>Accurſius</hi> ſaith, that they which do in this manner feare and fright folkes, ought (according to the lawes) to bee exiled and baniſhed, although the death of the parties do not happen therevpon. But if ſo be any do die thereof, he gathereth by divers lawes, that then they which were the cauſers of ſuch death, ſhould be puniſhed extraordinarily. But all this Diſcourſe of <hi>Accurſius,</hi> is vppon the expoſition of a certaine law of <hi>Paulus</hi> the <hi>Civilian,</hi> who ſaith: <q>Whoſoever ſhall do any thing whereby the ſimple ſpirits and mindes of men ſhall be frighted &amp; terrified through over great ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition: The Emperor <hi>Marcus</hi> willed and ordained, that ſuch a one ſhould be baniſhed into ſome Iſland.</q> And yet for all that, did not <hi>Accurſius</hi> either more or leſſe, vnderſtand the meaning of the law which he took vpon him to expound.<note place="margin">The French word is, <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latans,</hi> wherby is ment a kind of men, who in <hi>Arabia, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and other th'Eaſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries do vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by a kinde of charm, take vipers, ſcorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in their bare hands, &amp; ſo carrying them about, do ſell them.</note> For even thoſe very lawes which he alledged by way of argument: to what purpoſe doe they ſerve, as touching his explication? Their ſcope is not to entreate of any other thing, then of the Arrabian <hi>Scopeliſme,</hi> or of thoſe mountybanckes the which did vſe to carrie about Serpents: and not of any manner of feare conceived or apprehended through ſuperſtition. But this is in ſome ſort pardonable in <hi>Accurſius,</hi> who had not thoroughly ſearched nor turned over the good bookes of the antient Writers. And therefore he could
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:8919:94"/>not ſo well expound any of thoſe lawes that were drawn from the auntient hiſtories. For the truth is; that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of <hi>Marke Antonyne</hi> the Emperour, ſpecified and declared in this law, doth leade vs as it were by the hand, to the interpretation and vnderſtanding thereof; if wee regarde by the hiſtorie it ſelfe, the true motive that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that Emperour to make this Ordinance. Now the hiſtorie may well be gathered out of <hi>Iulius Capitolinus,</hi> who ſaith; that a certaine Impoſtor or coſening Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, making a ſpeech in the field of <hi>Mars,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In vita Marci Anto-philoſo.</note> vpon a wilde Figge-tree, tooke vpon him to fore-tell and prophecie, that the end of the world would bee very ſhortly after, if that he at ſuch time as he came downe out of that tree, were changed into a Storke. And within a while after, he deſcending them, let flie from his girdle, a Storke that he had hanging thereat, thinking by that deviſe, to have deluded and blinded the people: but he did it not ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, but he was diſcovered and apprehended and led before the Emperour <hi>Marke,</hi> who pardoned him: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he made an ordinance, by the which hee defended all men, of what condition and qualitie ſoever, not to feare and terrifie any man through ſuperſtition, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of religion, vpon paine to bee baniſhed, as we have ſaid before. So that you may ſee the true ſenſe of the law, drawne from this hiſtorie: albeit the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which <hi>Antonyne</hi> ordained, were leſſe rigorous then it ought to bee. For conſidering the greevouſnes of the offence, (namely, to ingender and breede a feare in a whole people, vnder pretence of a falſe miracle:) death it ſelfe was but a iuſt and due reward for the ſame.<note place="margin">Of Impoſtors and deceivers taking vpon them to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored as gods or deceiving men vnder a colour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note>

Now the third day after the adultery committed, <hi>Mondus</hi> meeting, by chaunce, with <hi>Paulina</hi> in the open ſtreete, ſaide vnto her: <hi>O Madam</hi> Paulina, <hi>what a goodly thing was it of you to ſpare and ſave mee two hundreth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand drachmes, which you might have put into your coffers, and have encreaſed your revenews therewith all? and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe you have yeelded vnto my amorous deſires and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. It cannot but greeve me, that thou ſhouldeſt deſpiſe thine owne</hi> Mondus, <hi>and yet after, vnder the maske and vaile of a God he ſhould have his pleaſure of thy beautie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more iuſtly deſerved it than any other whoſoever.</hi> And when hee had thus ſpoken vnto her, he paſſed on to the other ſide of the ſtreete, and ſo went on his way. <hi>Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> ſodainely became pale and red, ſtill chaunging her countenaunce, according as ſhame and deſpite did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly tranſporte her; and in an extreame rage and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhee beganne to teare and rend her garments, and to plucke her faire haires, and to wring her hands moſt pitteouſly. And being come to her owne houſe, ſhee diſcovered vnto her husband particularly, the villainous and diſſolute parte that <hi>Mondus</hi> had played her, entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, of all love, and by the affection of an husband which he bore vnto her, that he would not permitte the ſame to remayne vnpuniſhed. Her husband incenſed with wrath and choler beyond all meaſure, complained him of this villainous abuſe vnto the Emperour <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> who commaunded that informations ſhoulde bee preferred of this crime and offence: by meanes whereof the whole practiſe was diſcovered, as wee have deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed it.

For howſoever <hi>Oldradus</hi> one of our doctors of the Civill Lawe dooth in his Counſelles excuſe a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne amorous perſon, who was accuſed, for that in the rage and furie of his love hee had vſed Images of waxe made by Arte <hi>Magicke,</hi>

And be it that the rage of love is as great as hee would ſeeme to make it:<note place="margin">L. multi. C. de venef. &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them. cap. <hi>2.</hi> de Sortileg.</note> yet ſo it is, that Sorcery is an Election and voluntary Deliberation of the minde: and therefore in the will of him that vſeth it; the which can not be ſo excuſed, but that it is an acte and crime puniſhable and worthy of death. So that it is not the love that is to be puniſhed as a paſſion of rage and furie, but it is the Sorcerie that is to be chaſtiſed as a crime moſt hainous. But let vs now come to the third and laſt impoſture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farre more hatefull and deteſtable than any of the two former. It is recounted by <hi>Ruffine</hi> a Prieſt of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quileia</hi> in his Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtorie:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 25.</note> and thus it is.</p>
               <p>There was (ſaith he) in <hi>Alexandria</hi> a Cittie of <hi>Egypt,</hi> a certaine Prieſt a <hi>Pagan,</hi> one of them that vſed to offer ſacrifices vnto <hi>Saturne.</hi> This Prieſt was named both by his deedes and by his proper name, <hi>Tyrannus.</hi> Whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he fell to beinamored of any woman, either ſimple, Citizens wife, or any noble Ladie, and that he had a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:8919:100"/>deſire to have his pleaſure of her: for the ſatisfying of his diſordinate and luxurious appetites, hee would not ſticke to come vnto their husbands, how great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoever they were, (who came vſually to preſent their vowes and oriſons within the Temple of <hi>Saturne</hi>) and would tel them freely, that the god <hi>Saturne</hi> was inamord of their wives; and that they muſt not faile to ſend them in the evening to lie with him. Then hee (whoſoever it was that receved this commandement) became wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully glad and iocund, that his wife ſhould be held wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of the love of the greateſt of the gods that were in heaven, and was reputed to bee father of all the other gods. Wherefore, having trimmed and adorned her to the vtmoſt of his power, with the beſt veſtments, jewels, and trinckets that ſhe had, he would alſo give her many goodly preſents to beſtow vpon the god; to the intent ſhe might not be reiected and refuſed if ſhe ſhould come empty handed. This done, he ſent her away to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where <hi>Tyrannus</hi> received and welcomed her in the name of <hi>Saturne,</hi> and in the preſence of an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons there aſſembled. And then ſhutting her vp within the Temple, he gave the keyes to a third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be kept, and within a while after himſelfe depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and went away. Thus, when every bodie was gone and withdrawne to their owne home, and that the night was ſhut in, hee would then hide himſelfe (I know not how) in ſome hollow place made in the wall of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and there would enter into the image or idoll of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,</hi> which was made in that faſhion, that behinde it there was a great cleft or opening, by the which a man might well enter at his full length: and yet in all other parts it was ſo cimented &amp; ioynd cloſe to the wal, that no man could perceive the cleft opening on the other ſide. On all ſides of the Temple, were lamps and tapers bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and whilſt the dame was buſie praying vnto <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,</hi> preſently would <hi>Tyrannus</hi> ſound forth a voyce out of the concavitie and hollownes of this idoll, (being made
<pb facs="tcp:8919:101"/>of braſſe) and ſo would ſpeake vnto the dame, who it is not to be doubted, whether ſhe were not at the inſtant ſurpriſed both with feare &amp; ioy: with feare in hearing, (as ſhe imagined) a god ſpeake vnto her: &amp; with ioy, becauſe a god would vouchſafe to ſpeak vnto her ſo familiarly, &amp; to court her. So (not knowing or conceiving any thing of the fraude that was in the meane while intended to her diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Having by this meanes and deviſe, abuſed many chaſte and honeſt women. It happened that one Ladie of rare chaſtitie and pudicitie, was to follow the ſame daunce and being ſhut vp with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Temple as ſhe was one that did abhorre the crime of adulterie, (with whatſoever title it were covered or coloured) ſo did ſhe beginne to give attentive eare to the voyce that ſounded from the idoll: and having at length conceived and obſerved that it ſhould bee the voyce of <hi>Tyrannus,</hi> ſhe aroſe much troubled and diſquieted out of bed where ſhe lay, and repelled <hi>Tyrannus</hi> from her, to the vttermoſt of her power: Afterwards, the day light appearing, ſhe returned exceeding angry to her houſe, where ſhee recounted to her husband, the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ of the adulterer. The husband incenſed with the indignitie of the iniurie offered vnto his wife, (which hee held as being done to himſelfe) did not faile to frame an accuſation againſt <hi>Tyrannus,</hi> and followed the ſame ſo roundly againſt him, preſſing him ſo harde

               <p>And as touching the Fantaſie of one that is wiſe and diſcreete, <hi>Spherus,</hi> the diſciple of <hi>Lenon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How the Phantaſie &amp; Senſes may be deceived, and how not.</note> doth ſeeme (in my iudgement) very aptly and properly to diſtinguiſh betweene that which in the Fantaſie, is probable, or ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to be true; and that which is comprehenſible in very deede, certainely and truely. For one day, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by the king of <hi>Egypt Ptolomeus Philopater</hi> to a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet; and a diſputation being begunne at his table, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the opinion of a wiſe man, <hi>Spherus</hi> denied that a wiſe man did holde any opinion. The king purpoſing preſently to diſprove his ſaying, and to argue it to bee falſe, cauſed certaine fiſhes made of waxe and cunningly painted, (as if they had beene lively and naturall fiſhes,) to be brought and ſet vpon the table before him. And <hi>Spherus</hi> being deceived in them, the king beganne to tell him out alowd, that he had conſented to a falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Wherevnto, <hi>Spherus</hi> gave a prompt and readie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſaying; That in a probable kinde of coniecture he did take them to be fiſhes, but that his fantaſie did not therefore conſent vnto it. For there is (quoth he) a great difference betweene the fantaſie that iudgeth of a thing probably, and that which comprehendeth or knoweth it in certainety. So then, if a man be ſometimes deceived, as touching things naturall or artificiall, (of which, wee have formerly ſpoken and intreated at large) in taking them at the firſt ſight for things ſupernaturall and predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious: or if one doe miſtake things artificiall inſteede of naturall, yet nevertheles that maketh not, that his fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
<pb facs="tcp:8919:103"/>ſhould therefore be deceived, or that his ſenſes muſt needes bee troubled and altered.

For this cauſe, as they beganne to conceive a feare of ſuffering ſhipwracke, ſo did they labour and beſtirre themſelves to caſt out into the ſtreete, (as if it had beene into the ſea) whatſoever came to their hands, table, treſſells, ſtooles, pots, trenchers, bed-ſteedes, cups, glaſſes, and ſuch like, making thereby great ſport and paſtime to ſuch as being below, came running thither of all ſides, as vnto common largeſſe to take that which they threw downe into the ſtreete.

For though at this day the written lawes do conclude, the woman to be vnder the power and commaund of her husband; yet ſo it is, that the Emperor <hi>Marke Antonyne,</hi> did authorize &amp; privilege a certain maried woman that was a chriſtian, by his writing, to have the governement and adminiſtration of her owne goods, becauſe her husband, being a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then

Wherefore ſeeing it is moſt certaine, that women are naturally ſo fraile and weake; it muſt needes be, that feare is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attending vpon them, and dooth ever accompanie them: and it doth eaſily imprint ſundry imaginations in their mindes, like as a man would make in waxe, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ſome character with a Ring or Signet. And it muſt needes be, that their feare and apprehenſion is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, ſeeing their imagination doth engender ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous effects in nature, as nothing more. And letting paſſe whatſoever is written heereof in antient hiſtories, I will onely in this place, recite a certaine accident which befell of late, even in our time; the ſame being a thing as marvellous as any one thing that you ſhall obſerve in any Authors whatſoever. There was a certaine gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in a village neere the Towne of <hi>Argenton</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man borne in Normandie.</note> which complotted with ſome of the inhabitants of that Village to play certaine plaies, wherein ſhould be acted certaine divells, to the intent the pleaſure and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime of their Pageant might be the greater.<note place="margin">Of humane parts in forme of a monſter.</note> And this Gentleman would needes himſelfe bee apparrelled and attired in the habite of a divell, and did play the part of a divell: inſomuch, as after the plaies were ended, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in a heate and chafed in his furniture, went home to his wife, lay with her, and had her companie clad in the ſame attire wherein he had played the divell: By meanes wherof, it hapned that his wife (were it either by ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement imagination that ſurprized her, or elſe (which I rather beleeve) through a very feare which ſeized vppon her, and is naturally in the hearts of all women) ſhe was delivered at the nine moneths end, of a ſonne ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, as in his countenance, his head, his face, and all the other parts of his body, eſpecially in his feete, hee reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb facs="tcp:8919:121"/>and was more like vnto a Satyre, ſuch as the Poets have deſcribed, then vnto an ordinarie and naturall man. After this, ſhee had other children by her husband, all which, (together with their brother the monſter) did ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive both their father and their mother. Vpon whoſe deceaſe, there grew a contention and variance betweene them, touching the ſucceſſion of his inheritance. All of them endevouring to exclude this monſter their elder brother, not onely from the birth-right of being heire and eldeſt ſonne, but even from the totall ſucceſſion of any thing that hee ſhould claime, or that might in right appertaine vnto him. Heerevpon was the proceſſe ſued, and the matter proceeded in ſuite betweene them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ludge of an inferiour Court; by whome it was ordered, that they ſhoulde make their entry vppon the inheritance, and that the eldeſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhoulde inherite, as next heire vnto his father and mother, according to the cuſtome of <hi>Normandie.</hi> From this ſentence the younger brethren brought their appeale,<note place="margin">Of a proceſſe or ſute in an appeal broght againſt the ſaid monſter by his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren vpon claime of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</note> and remooved it into the Court of Parliament of <hi>Roan,</hi> where the cauſe was pleaded: And the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brethren being Appellants did aleadge; <q>That they had great and iuſt cauſe to complaine vpon the wrong done them, not onely, in that their brother was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the birth-right of being heire and eldeſt ſonne to their father: but alſo that hee ſhould bee adiudged to, have any parte in the ſucceſſion of that living, which neither did, nor could in any ſort fall or appertayne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, by any Lawes, either divine or humane. For, beſides that hee was a very monſter borne, and even againſt the ordinary courſe of nature: And therefore was to be excluded for that onely cauſe from all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rights and priviledges, as well of any legitimate and lawfull portion, as of the birth-right and priviledge of the firſt borne.

And it may be that the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſian Virgins</hi> (of whom <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth) were ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with this maladie, which conſtrained them to hang themſelves:<note place="margin">Defoemin. illuſtr.</note> and yet the citizens of <hi>Miletum</hi> could never diſcover not finde out, what ſhould be the occaſion, that ſhoulde make them to execute that cruelty vppon their owne perſons.

And having well profited in the ſtudie of the lawes, hee would go to <hi>Venice;</hi> where hee was no ſooner arrived, but he was entrapped in the ſnares of love. Wherevpon hee often frequented the doore of his Miſtreſſe houſe, and made many ſignes and tokens of the great love and affection which he bare vnto her: he aſſayed by preſents and by the helpe of Panders to corrupt her: and in the end himſelfe hardily diſcovered his love vnto her, and prayed her to have pitty and compaſſion vpon him.

But in the end, ſeeing himſelfe altogether hopeleſſe to gaine her to his deſire, and being

So they went both together to the Church of Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> where at that time the Duke of <hi>Venyſe</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: whom as ſoone as this amorous foole ſaw, hee cried out alowde preſently vnto his companion: See, there is he with whom I have the quarrell; goe, let vs ſet vpon him. His companion ſtirred not, but onely ſhaking his head, ſmiled at him, imagining that the other did but ieſt with him; for he did not thinke that he was turned foole. But a ſuddaine admiration and aſtoniſhment tooke him as ſoone as hee ſawe this amorous mad-man to caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe through the Duke his guarde, and that drawing his ſword, hee ſtrived with the vtmoſt of his ſtrength and endevours to kill him: which hee had alſo done, if the guard of the Duke had not reſtrained and hindered him, by whom alſo he was bounden and led away to priſon. The matter being yet hote, hee was examined what ſhould moove him to this deſperate action: But he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered nothing but fooleries and idle ieaſts and toyes. By chance there was then reſiding in <hi>Venice,</hi> that great and renowmed Phiſitian <hi>Fracaſtor,</hi> who was ſent for, and this amorous Gentleman was ſhewed vnto him: who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had long regarded and beheld him, and queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him vpon many points and occurrences: And perceiving that his anſwers did tend to nothing elſe but to menaces, and to diſcourſes of women and wenches, he knew immediately that ſome amorous conceit was the cauſe of his outrage, &amp; affirmed as much at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to the Magiſtrate; promiſing, that if he might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into his hands, he would cure &amp; recover him of this frenſie.

And therefore the childe may ſee the theefe naturally, by reaſon of the puritie, force, ſubtiltie, and agilitie of his ſpirits: And ſeeing it is to be preſuppoſed that the ſoule is immortall: this is not more ſtrange or miraculous, then the experience which we have of the Adamant, which draweth the Iron vnto it.</q>

The which is a thing worthie to be marked, and doth evidently ſhew vnto all ſuch vndiſcreete perſons, as would have men to be transformed into woolves, how much their mindes and vnderſtanding are ſubiect to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie and indiſcretion, that they cannot make any profite, but do wreſt to their owneſenſe, that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well examined, doth make altogether againſt them. For in that the Scripture ſaith, the nailes of <hi>Nabuchodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nozer</hi> did grow in ſuch a manner, and that hee did eate hay as an Oxe: it giveth vs to vnderſtand, that his forme or ſhape was not changed, but that hee had ſo loſt the vſe of reaſon and his vnderſtanding, that hee thought and imagined himſelfe to: bee a beaſt, and hee didde therefore eate hay as a beaſt; not that hee was really
<pb facs="tcp:8919:145"/>and indeede a beaſt. For ſeeing his eſſentiall forme was not changed, (as themſelves do confeſſe) and the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and reaſonable parts of man are two eſſences ſo linc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and conioyned together, that before the day of death, they can never be ſeperated: how can it be, that the reaſonable part being not poſſible to bee changed, becauſe it is eſſentiall to man; (as themſelves alleadge) yet the body which is vnited, and tyed vnto the reaſon and vnderſtanding, ſhould, and may notwithſtanding bee changed and transformed? Certainely the bodie of man and the ſoule are Relatives: and a man cannot preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a humane body to be living and walking, but hee muſt give vnto it a reaſonable ſoule: and ſo likewiſe on the contrarie part, wee cannot take any conſideration heere below of a living ſoule vſing reaſon, but we muſt give it a body proportioned with all the draughts, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and lineaments of a man. This being a thing ſo true and certaine, as to make a doubt thereof, would be a manifeſt errour, and againſt the principles of naturall Philoſophie: How can it then bee, that the ſoule being not to be changed by their owne confeſſion, our bodies nevertheleſſe ſhould bee changed and take the body of a beaſt?</p>
               <p>But they inferre yet further &amp; ſay, men have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make a cherry-tree or ſuch like plant,<note place="margin">Obiection by ſundry exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> to beare and bring foorth roſes or apples, and they can change yron into ſteele, and the forme of ſilver into gold: wherefore then ſhould it be thought ſo ſtrange a matter, that the divell ſhould change the figure of a body, into ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhape, ſeeing his power doth by farre exceede that of men?<note place="margin">Solution and anſwer to the firſt example.</note> Goodly compariſons no doubt: as though the man (which doth graft in a tree a roſe or any other graft) be he, that doth cauſe to grow within or vpon the tree, or the wilde ſtocke, that which is ſo ſtrange and different from the proper ſubſtance of the tree; and not rather nature it ſelfe, which by meanes of the ſappe of the tree mounting to the graft, doth make it to be incorporated
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:8919:145"/>and vnited to the barke and body of the ſame tree, and (as <hi>Virgil</hi> ſaith) <hi>Vdo facit in eleſcere libro.</hi> Certaine it is, that he which doth graft it, doth nothing elſe but lend his hands to Nature, the which, (as touching the reſt) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the power that God hath given it, doth worke and bring it forth, cauſing it to come to theſe effects as we ſee. The which, howſoever they may ſeeme marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, yet are they notwithſtanding meerely naturall and eaſie to bee comprehended, as proceeding from that which doth delight in the diverſitie of her worke: and as <hi>Petronius Arbiter</hi> ſaith;</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Non vno contenta valet natura tenore</l>

                  <l>Never contented with one kinde of working.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Now God hath not given ſuch power vnto the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, ſo to transforme any body into another, and to alter and change the ſubſtance thereof in any ſort; neither is there any likeneſſe or identity of reaſon, betweene the grafting of a tree, and the tranſmutation of an entire and ſolide ſubſtance into another body. And more then that, howſoevering grafting of any thing, a man do cut away even halfe the ſtocke to incorporate the graft, yet doth the ſtocke ſtill remaine the ſame, and the graft taketh it noriture of the ſappe of the ſtocke, and doth retaine the nature thereof: and that this is ſo, it is apparant, for that in the grafting of roſes vpon an hawthorne, or other wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or an oke, they will grow to be greene, by reaſon of the ſappe of the wilding, or of the oke. And therefore the nature of the tree is not ſo changed by the new graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it, but that a man may eaſily take knowledge of the firſt ſubſtance thereof, the which is farre otherwiſe in the ſubſtance of any man, that is ſaid to be changed and transformed by the divell: for that therein cannot be diſcerned the tract or ſhew of any humane ſhape. So that then the divell muſt bee acknowledged to bee of more
<pb facs="tcp:8919:146"/>might and puiſſance then Nature it ſelfe, the which the Hebrewes did eſteeme in a maner as a god.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to the 2. example.</note>Now as touching that they alleadge, that man doth change yron into ſteele, and ſilver into gold; they do not ſee how therein they doe moſt groſely and abſurdly ſpeake againſt themſelves. For I will vſe no other then their owne compariſon to refell all thoſe that ſhall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the tranſmutation of any true ſubſtance. For as it is moſt certaine, that yron doth eaſily refine it ſelfe into that which in nature is next and neereſt vnto it, that is, ſteele: nevertheleſſe it is alwaies yron, and is eaſie to be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from that ſteele which is fine and naturall. And as ſilver (being molten and diſſolved with matters of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature) may eaſily take the colour of gold, and come to counterfait and adulterate the ſame, and yet is not able to change it, but that it will be diſcovered for ſuch as it is, being tried either with the graver, the touchſtone, the hammer, or ſome ſuch meanes: In like manner, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell (howſoever by charming the eyes and ſight of the beholders, hee doe ſeeme in ſome ſort to adulterate and falſifie the ſubſtance of man, in making it appeare other then it is indeede: yet nevertheleſſe doth not the humane ſubſtance ſuffer any change or alteration.

In the ſame ſort, howſoever the divell doth repreſent vnder the true forme of a man, ſome woolfe, horſe, mule,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:8919:146"/>or ſome ſuch other beaſt: yet nevertheleſſe the man doth ſtill abide and remaine the ſame that he was, and hee is not either changed or transformed in any faſhion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, but onely in the imagination of the phantaſie, which is poſſeſſed and troubled by the divell. And this both all the antient Doctours of the Church, and all the generall Counſells have determined and agreed vppon. And therefore I cannot but marvel, that there ſhould be any men ſo obſtinately addicted and wilfully wedded to their opinions, as to bring in and maintaine againſt all antiquitie, and contrarie to the Canons, a new kinde of hereſie, the which they goe about to proove, onely by ſuch authorities and examples, as they do wreſt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to their owne ſenſe and meaning: wherein they doe ſomething ſavour of the error of <hi>Manes,</hi> the father of the <hi>Manichees; Qui aliquid divinitatis aut numinis extra vnum Deum arbitrabatur:</hi> 
                  <q>who did hold, that there was a kinde of divine power, beſides that of the one onely God. For he ſaid, that there were two creators, the one of things earthly and materiall; the other of things ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall, which doth even iumpe with the opinion of thoſe men.</q> For to make the divell to have ſuch power, as to change the bodie of man into another forme; what other thing is it, then to give and attribute vnto him that power and puiſſance, as to create a new forme, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into give him a kinde of prerogative over the body of man, which is a thing onely reſerved vnto God alone, the creator of all things, both viſible and inviſible, corporall and incorporall.</p>
               <p>But this ſhall ſuffice as touching Sorcerers, and that tranſmutation which they do maintaine of humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies into the bodie; of ſome other creature: The which in very deede, neither is, nor can be doone, but onely in apparance (as wee have oftentimes formerly repeated) and onely by the phantaſie and imagination corrupted and deluded by the preſtigious deceipts and illuſions of the divell.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:8919:150"/>why the divells do the more exerciſe their rage, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the encreaſe of the Moone, is for two reſpects.

You may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone beleeve the one as the other: for all phiſicke, all ſuperſtitions, and Coniura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are of like efficacie in this caſe. Opinion of the Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers confuted.

               <p>But to come to other matters of this kinde: As little reaſon alſo have the Aſtrologers to attribute vnto their Starres ſuch force and influence, as to ſay, That they doe infuſe and inſtill into humane bodies certaine admirable faculties, and ſo doe cauſe them to ſpeake divers and ſtraunge languages: for their opinion is as farre from the trueth, and to be abhorred, as that of the Phiſitians, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they finde any reaſons, whereby they are able, or ought to perſwade, that the Starres are the cauſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch myracle chauncing in the bodies of men. And howſoever for proofe of their Aſſertion they doe vrge, That the Moone, according to the encreaſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing thereof dooth produce very terrible effectes in the bodies of Lunatique perſons: and that according to certaine conſtellations of the Starres the corporall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is diſpoſed more or leſſe to receive the celeſtiall Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions: yet dooth it not followe for all that, That the Lunatiques in ſpeaking and vttering diverſe languages, are not ſurpriſed and poſſeſſed by the Divell, but that the ſame their diverſity of tongues ſhould proceed from the Starres. For what ſhould I ſay more?

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:8919:160"/>and doe accord in this; That charmes have the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, not onely to woorke and procure love, to alter health, and to tranſport the fruites of the ground from one field or place to another; but to do alſo things farre more marvellous and woonderfull than theſe. The Magitians of <hi>Pharao</hi> (by their charmes) thought to make themſelves equall with <hi>Moſes</hi> the meſſenger of God. The <hi>Epheſians</hi> had certaine markes and magike wordes (I know not what) of inchantment, by which any thing whatſoever they did once attempt and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, did ſucceede well and anſwerable to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. And ſuch markes or characters (as <hi>Euſtathius</hi> the Interpreter of <hi>Homer</hi> writeth) didde <hi>Croeſus</hi> vſe at ſuch time as hee was vppon the pile of wood ready to be burned by the commaundement of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> The <hi>Brachmans</hi> (as <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith) didde not vſe ſo much to heale and cure diſeaſes by hearbs and ſimples, as they did by charmes: And <hi>Iohn Leo</hi> the <hi>Affricane</hi> writeth, that in the high mountaines of <hi>Marocco</hi> there be three Apples of Gold of an ineſtimable price and value, the which are ſo wel and ſurely guarded by inchantments, that the kings of <hi>Fez,</hi> could never get to come neere them, albeit they have many &amp; ſundty times attempted the ſame. And that (which doth yet more ſhew the force and power of wordes) may bee ſeene in <hi>Galen,</hi> howe that a certaine Enchaunter did kill a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion by the pronouncing of one onely worde. And although that <hi>Galen</hi> himſelfe as a Naturaliſt, doth thinke to ſalve the matter by ſaying; that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter did firſt ſpet, before he pronounced any thing, and that all the force was in his ſpettle, and not in his wordes: yet cannot he make any man beleeve, that the ſpettle or any exerement of a man, hath ſo much power, as to kill one ſo readily. Moreover, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliator named <hi>Peter de Albano</hi> a phiſitian telles a great deale more than ever <hi>Galon</hi> knew, to wit, that he himſelf faw a certaine enchantet,<note place="margin">
